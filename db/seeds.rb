British counter-revolutionary thought often focused on the suffering of the monarchy in their stories, such as the King’s tearful goodbye to his family before his execution on Jan. 21st, 1793 or Marie-Antoinette’s perhaps apocryphal last words to her executioner after stepping on his foot just before her head was cut off: “Pardon me sir.

The <em>sans-culottes</em> were violent—but they had their reasons.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/cLJ1vuUWprA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></span></p>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126385\" data-article-id=\"297219\" class=\"annotatable\">Mélenchon is also offended by the depiction of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/robespierre_maximilien.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Maximilien de Robespierre</a> in the game. “And the man who was our liberator at a certain moment of the Revolution… is presented as a monster,” he said. Robespierre rose from his beginnings as a humble provincial lawyer to become one of the central figures of the Terror, a period where anyone perceived to be an enemy of the Revolution was viciously beheaded.

As such, opinions over who is right and wrong during the Revolution often say more about the person making the claim than the events themselves. In his novel, “The Unbearable Lightness of Being,” Milan Kundera reflects on what the passage of time does to history:</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126388\" data-article-id=\"297219\" class=\"annotatable\">If the French Revolution were to recur eternally, French historians would be less proud of Robespierre.

There is an infinite difference between a Robespierre who occurs only once in history and Robespierre who eternally returns, chopping off French heads.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"item-share-tools article-footer\">\r\n<div class=\"short-url\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"shortURL\" value=\"http://qz.com/297219\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"share-buttons colored\"><ul data-author=\"Kabir Chibber\" data-title=\"The new “Assassin’s Creed” game is reviving an ancient debate over the French Revolution\" data-on=\"none\">\r\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a title=\"Tweet\" class=\"share-action icon-twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20new%20%E2%80%9CAssassin%E2%80%99s%20Creed%E2%80%9D%20game%20is%20reviving%20an%20ancient%20debate%20over%20the%20French%20Revolution&amp;url=http://qz.com/297219&amp;via=qz\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a title=\"Share on Facebook\" class=\"share-action icon-facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://qz.com/297219\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"linkedin\"><a title=\"Share on LinkedIn\" class=\"share-action icon-linkedin\" href=\"http://linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=http://qz.com/297219&amp;title=The%20new%20%E2%80%9CAssassin%E2%80%99s%20Creed%E2%80%9D%20game%20is%20reviving%20an%20ancient%20debate%20over%20the%20French%20Revolution&amp;summary=The%20latest%C2%A0%E2%80%9CAssassin%E2%80%99s%20Creed:%20Unity%E2%80%9D%20video%20game%20allows%20you,%20the%20player,%20to%20roam%20freely%20around%20an%20ancient%20city%20as%20part%20of%20its%C2%A0usual,%20incomprehensible%20plot%20about%20assassins,%20conspiracy,%20and%20revenge.%20But%20this%20time,%20the%20game%20is%20set%20in%20Paris%20during%20the%20French%20Revolution,%20and%20the%20game%20is%20ruffling%20a%20few%20feathers%20in%20France%20for%20its%20depiction%20of%20%5B%E2%80%A6%5D\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"email\"><a title=\"Email\" class=\"share-action icon-email\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Quartz:%20The%20new%20%E2%80%9CAssassin%E2%80%99s%20Creed%E2%80%9D%20game%20is%20reviving%20an%20ancient%20debate%20over%20the%20French%20Revolution&amp;body=http://qz.com/297219%0A%0AThe%20latest%C2%A0%E2%80%9CAssassin%E2%80%99s%20Creed:%20Unity%E2%80%9D%20video%20game%20allows%20you,%20the%20player,%20to%20roam%20freely%20around%20an%20ancient%20city%20as%20part%20of%20its%C2%A0usual,%20incomprehensible%20plot%20about%20assassins,%20conspiracy,%20and%20revenge.%20But%20this%20time,%20the%20game%20is%20set%20in%20Paris%20during%20the%20French%20Revolution,%20and%20the%20game%20is%20ruffling%20a%20few%20feathers%20in%20France%20for%20its%20depiction%20of%20%5B%E2%80%A6%5D%0A%0A\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"whatsapp\"><a title=\"Share on WhatsApp\" class=\"share-action icon-whats-app\" href=\"whatsapp://send?text=The%20new%20%E2%80%9CAssassin%E2%80%99s%20Creed%E2%80%9D%20game%20is%20reviving%20an%20ancient%20debate%20over%20the%20French%20Revolution:%20http://qz.com/297219\"></a></li>\r\n</ul></div>\r\n<div id=\"related-headlines-297219\" class=\"empty\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>"},

Gates and Buffett gave the same one-word answer: “Focus.” (See more in <em>The Snowball</em> by Alice Schroeder).</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84367\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">I love the clarity of their answer but I am also concerned by how this can be, to quote Rudyard Kipling, “twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools.” I am an advocate for focus in work, life and leadership. However, the subject has a nuance and depth that many people miss. For a start, most people think of there only being one kind of focus.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2>Focus as a noun</h2>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84368\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">When people speak of focus they usually mean having a single goal. It is a static thing, a thing you <em>have</em>. This kind of focus conjures pictures of Roger Bannister relentlessly pursuing his goal of breaking the four-minute mile, John F. Kennedy challenging NASA to put a man on the moon within a decade or, coming back to Bill Gates, a vision of a personal computer on every desk. The upside to this kind of focus is clear and compelling: you pursue a single objective and don’t get distracted along the way; you build momentum as many different people aligned behind achieving this one goal.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84369\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">However, there is a dark side to focus as a noun. It’s what we might think of as the Kodak Problem. Kodak was relentlessly focused on a single objective—and it almost killed them. They found themselves caught off guard by the disruptive innovation of digital cameras. Kodak was so focused on optimizing for traditional film capture and processing that they did not see or accept the transformation in their industry. This is where the second type of focus comes in.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2>Focus as a verb</h2>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84370\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Focus is not just something you <em>have</em> it is also something you <em>do</em>. This type of focus is not static; it is an intense, dynamic, ongoing, iterative process. This kind of focus conjures pictures of Steve Jobs saying to Jony Ive day after day, “This might be crazy, but what if we…” until once in a while the idea took the air out of the room. It’s the constant exploration needed to see what is really going on and what the “noun focus” should be.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84371\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Imagine if the moment you woke up this morning your eyes focused one time and then never adjusted again. You would be out of focus all day. Our eyes produce clarity through a perpetual process of adjustment. Similarly, in our lives and on our teams, it is not enough to say, “We have our focus!” Rather, and adapting Dwight D. Eisenhower statement, “Focus is nothing, focusing is everything.” That may take the point too far, but it still makes the point that having a focus is insufficient.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84372\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">The downside to thinking of focus as a verb only, is that it can lead to being overly reactive. It can lead people to making and remaking decisions too fast for any real momentum to take place. It can result in counterfeit agility where things feel fast but people aren’t going forward. It can become motion sickness instead of momentum.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84373\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">The answer is to develop and value both types of focus. Professor Henry Mintzberg taught that there are two sources of strategy:</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Deliberate strategy</strong>, where leaders develop a clear vision and map this to long, medium and short term goals (focus as a noun);</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>emergent strategy</strong>, where people respond to unanticipated problems and opportunities (focus as a verb).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84374\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">It is the disciplined pursuit of both of these approaches that best enables us to focus on what is essential. We can plot this on a two by two to see what is at stake.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-231910\" src=\"http://img.qz.com/2014/07/2.jpg?w=900&amp;h=551\" alt=\"2\" width=\"900\" height=\"551\"></p>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84375\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Here are three ways to combine both types of focus to ensure we getting the vital few things done.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2>Ask the right questions</h2>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84376\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Bill Gates said of Warren Buffett,<em> “</em>I first met him… at a dinner my mother had put together. On my way there, I thought, ‘Why would I want to meet this guy who picks stocks?’ I thought he just used various market-related things—like volume, or how the price had changed over time—to make his decisions. But when we started talking that day, he didn’t ask me about any of those things. Instead he started asking big questions about the fundamentals of our business. ‘Why can’t IBM do what Microsoft does? Why has Microsoft been so profitable?’ That’s when I realized he thought about business in a much more profound way than I’d given him credit for.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"1\" data-thread-id=\"84377\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">In order to have focus we need to escape to focus. As I wrote in <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-The-Disciplined-Pursuit-Less/dp/0804137382/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400517057&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=essentialism+the+disciplined+pursuit+of+less\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essentialism</a>, “</em>I once attended a question-and-answer session with Bill at the headquarters of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington. By chance he had just completed his latest ‘Think Week.’ Though I had heard about this practice, what I didn’t know was that it goes all the way back to the 1980s and that he stuck to it through the height of Micro- soft’s expansion. In other words, twice a year, during the busiest and most frenetic time in the company’s history, he still created time and space to seclude himself for a week and do nothing but read articles (his record is 112) and books, study technology, and think about the bigger picture. Today he still takes the time away from the daily distractions of running his foundation to simply think. Whether you can invest two hours a day, two weeks a year, or even just five minutes every morning, it is important to make space to escape in your busy life.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"1\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">1</div></div></div></div>\r\n<h2>Know how valuable your time is</h2>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84378\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">As Bill Gates has written, “No matter how much money you have, you can’t buy more time. There are only 24 hours in everyone’s day. Warren has a keen sense of this. He doesn’t let his calendar get filled up with useless meetings. On the other hand, he’s very generous with his time for the people he trusts. He gives his close advisers at Berkshire his phone number, and they can just call him up and he’ll answer the phone.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84379\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Focusing on what is essential is a powerful ability, perhaps the most powerful in a world where we are so bombarded with distracting ideas, information and opinions. However, if we want to consistently give our energies to what is essential we need to develop both kinds of focus. Only in this way can we answer with confidence the question, “What’s important now?”</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84380\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\"><em>This post originally appeared at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140707144749-8353952-the-one-word-answer-to-why-bill-gates-and-warren-buffett-have-been-so-successful?trk=mp-reader-card\">LinkedIn</a>.

Last year, regulators found that Wanfu Biotechnology Agricultural Development had overstated its financials for four years in a row, adding 740 million yuan ($120 million) to is revenues. Another biotechnology company, Yunnan Green-Land Biological, faked its assets and revenues for three years in a row <a href=\"http://english.caixin.com/2013-02-28/100495592.html\" target=\"_blank\">before being caught</a>.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126499\" data-article-id=\"297392\" class=\"annotatable\">China’s regulators have tacitly acknowledged that the Shanghai exchange has troubles with transparency. The Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323864304578318101227205828\">suspended all new IPOs</a> for a 14 month period in 2012 while it worked on a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-01/china-sets-ipo-reform-plan-signaling-end-of-freeze-on-listings.html\">new registration system</a> to prevent the wide-scale <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/01/us-china-brokerages-idUSBRE95002X20130601\">fraud</a> that was plaguing new listings. Ping An Securities, which brought Wanfu to the market, had its underwriting privileges <a href=\"http://http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/780998.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">halted for three months</a> after the fraud came to light.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126500\" data-article-id=\"297392\" class=\"annotatable\">Stock Connect also poses custody and settlement issues for investors on both sides of the market. In a possible attempt to limit day trading, investors cannot buy and sell a given stock on the same day. Daily and aggregate quotas will also cap trading on both sides, although many analysts believe these will eventually be removed.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126501\" data-article-id=\"297392\" class=\"annotatable\">Still, the through train that starts running today marks a monumental change in the Chinese government’s regulation of its financial markets. “China doesn’t do things on gut instinct,” said Chris Jenkins, Asia Pacific managing director of the trading technology group Tora. “It has a plan, and this is the start of the opening up of China’s capital markets to foreign investment.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126502\" data-article-id=\"297392\" class=\"annotatable\">Horth was even more effusive about the opportunities. “I don’t think there has been a time in my professional career, and that’s 25 years, where investors have seen a market of this size and opportunity open up,” he said.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126503\" data-article-id=\"297392\" class=\"annotatable\">The government is trying to push forward with market reforms and anti-corruption campaigns, and many market analysts believe that new institutional money being invested in Shanghai stocks may ultimately improve transparency and regulatory standards. Allen warned, however, that this “won’t happen overnight.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"item-share-tools article-footer\">\r\n<div class=\"short-url\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"shortURL\" value=\"http://qz.com/297392\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"share-buttons colored\"><ul data-author=\"Georgia McCafferty\" data-title=\"Now absolutely everyone can invest in China’s risky, fraud-ridden stock market\" data-on=\"future-of-finance\">\r\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a title=\"Tweet\" class=\"share-action icon-twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Now%20absolutely%20everyone%20can%20invest%20in%20China%E2%80%99s%20risky,%20fraud-ridden%20stock%20market&amp;url=http://qz.com/297392&amp;via=qz\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a title=\"Share on Facebook\" class=\"share-action icon-facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://qz.com/297392\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"linkedin\"><a title=\"Share on LinkedIn\" class=\"share-action icon-linkedin\" href=\"http://linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=http://qz.com/297392&amp;title=Now%20absolutely%20everyone%20can%20invest%20in%20China%E2%80%99s%20risky,%20fraud-ridden%20stock%20market&amp;summary=HONG%20KONG%20%E2%80%93%20It%E2%80%99s%20been%20a%20bumpy%20ride%20beset%20by%20delays%20and%20last-minute%20clarifications,%20but%20today%20marks%20the%20start%20of%20trading%20in%20the%20much-anticipated%20Shanghai-Hong%20Kong%20Stock%20Connect,%20or%20as%20it%E2%80%99s%20known%20colloquially,%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20through-train.%E2%80%9D%20This%20landmark%20agreement%20between%20the%20Shanghai%20and%20Hong%20Kong%20Stock%20Exchanges%20will%20give%20foreign%20investors%20direct%20access%20to%20Shanghai-listed%20shares%20%5B%E2%80%A6%5D\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"email\"><a title=\"Email\" class=\"share-action icon-email\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Quartz:%20Now%20absolutely%20everyone%20can%20invest%20in%20China%E2%80%99s%20risky,%20fraud-ridden%20stock%20market&amp;body=http://qz.com/297392%0A%0AHONG%20KONG%20%E2%80%93%20It%E2%80%99s%20been%20a%20bumpy%20ride%20beset%20by%20delays%20and%20last-minute%20clarifications,%20but%20today%20marks%20the%20start%20of%20trading%20in%20the%20much-anticipated%20Shanghai-Hong%20Kong%20Stock%20Connect,%20or%20as%20it%E2%80%99s%20known%20colloquially,%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20through-train.%E2%80%9D%20This%20landmark%20agreement%20between%20the%20Shanghai%20and%20Hong%20Kong%20Stock%20Exchanges%20will%20give%20foreign%20investors%20direct%20access%20to%20Shanghai-listed%20shares%20%5B%E2%80%A6%5D%0A%0A\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"whatsapp\"><a title=\"Share on WhatsApp\" class=\"share-action icon-whats-app\" href=\"whatsapp://send?text=Now%20absolutely%20everyone%20can%20invest%20in%20China%E2%80%99s%20risky,%20fraud-ridden%20stock%20market:%20http://qz.com/297392\"></a></li>\r\n</ul></div>\r\n<div id=\"related-headlines-297392\" class=\"empty\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>"},

Instead of making the test optional, favoring students and parents who are knowledgeable about the system and assertive, this system can help identify innate talent, the theory goes.<b> </b></p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<figure id=\"image-297329\" class=\"inline-image  alignleft zoomable size-medium\"><div class=\"inline-image-tools\">\r\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"share-button\" data-image-id=\"297329\">Share</a><div class=\"share-icons desaturated\">\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F289843%2F60-years-late-the-us-is-finally-trying-to-desegregate-its-classrooms%2Fi%2F297329%2F&amp;text=Finally%2C+the+US+admits+it%3A+AP+classes+are+way+too+white&amp;via=qz\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"icon-twitter\"></a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F289843%2F60-years-late-the-us-is-finally-trying-to-desegregate-its-classrooms%2Fi%2F297329%2F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"icon-facebook\"></a>\r\n</div>\r\n<span class=\"help-text\"><i class=\"icon-zoom\"></i>Tap image to zoom</span>\r\n</div>\r\n<img src=\"http://img.qz.com/2014/11/ap-book.jpg?w=640\" data-retina=\"http://img.qz.com/2014/11/ap-book.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" title=\"White and Asian students are disproportionately represented in advanced placement classes across the country.\"><figcaption class=\"inline-image-caption\">White and Asian students are disproportionately represented in advanced placement classes across the country.<span class=\"inline-image-credit\">(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)</span></figcaption></figure><p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126672\" data-article-id=\"289843\">Another option would be to remove barriers to entry in the advanced classes altogether, and to allow students to self-select their classes instead of test into them.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126673\" data-article-id=\"289843\">Students do learn at different paces, Theokas says: That is important to understand and accept in order to bring equality into the classroom.

The hallmark of emotional intelligence is self-control—a skill that unleashes massive productivity by keeping you focused and on track.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126331\" data-article-id=\"297134\" class=\"annotatable\">Unfortunately, self-control is a difficult skill to rely on. Self-control is so fleeting for most people that when Martin Seligman and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania surveyed two million people and asked them to rank order their strengths in 24 different skills, self-control ended up in the very bottom slot.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<div class=\"inline-ad  ad-visible\"><iframe id=\"537516121_jkuk\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px;\"></iframe></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126332\" data-article-id=\"297134\" class=\"annotatable\">And when your self-control leaves something to be desired, so does your productivity.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126333\" data-article-id=\"297134\">When it comes to self-control, it is so easy to focus on your failures that your successes tend to pale in comparison. And why shouldn’t they? Self-control is an effort that’s intended to help achieve a goal. Failing to control yourself is just that—a failure. If you’re trying to avoid digging into that bag of chips after dinner because you want to lose a few pounds and you succeed Monday and Tuesday nights only to succumb to temptation on Wednesday by eating four servings’ worth of the empty calories, your failure outweighs your success. You’ve taken two steps forward and four steps back.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126334\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Since self-control is something we could all use a little help with, I went back to the data to uncover the kinds of things that emotionally intelligent people do to keep themselves productive and in control. They consciously apply these twelve behaviors because they know they work. Some are obvious, others counter-intuitive, but all will help you minimize those pesky failures to boost your productivity.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2><strong>1. They forgive themselves</strong></h2>\r\n<p class=\"p2 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126335\" data-article-id=\"297134\">A vicious cycle of failing to control oneself followed by feeling intense self-hatred and disgust is common in attempts at self-control. These emotions typically lead to over-indulging in the offending behavior. When you slip up, it is critical that you forgive yourself and move on. Don’t ignore how the mistake makes you feel; just don’t wallow in it. Instead, shift your attention to what you’re going to do to improve yourself in the future.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p2 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126336\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Failure can erode your self-confidence and make it hard to believe you’ll achieve a better outcome in the future. Most of the time, failure results from taking risks and trying to achieve something that isn’t easy. Emotionally intelligent people know that success lies in their ability to rise in the face of failure, and they can’t do this when they’re living in the past. Anything worth achieving is going to require you to take some risks, and you can’t allow failure to stop you from believing in your ability to succeed. When you live in the past, that is exactly what happens, and your past becomes your present, preventing you from moving forward.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2 class=\"p4\">2. They don’t say yes unless they really want to<strong><br></strong>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p3 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126337\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Research conducted at the University of California in San Francisco shows that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you are to experience stress, burnout, and even depression, all of which erode self-control. Saying no is indeed a major self-control challenge for many people. “No” is a powerful word that you should not be afraid to wield. When it’s time to say no, emotionally intelligent people avoid phrases like “I don’t think I can” or “I’m not certain.” Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them. Just remind yourself that saying no is an act of self-control now that will increase your future self-control by preventing the negative effects of over commitment.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2 class=\"p4\">3.They don’t seek perfection</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p3 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126338\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Emotionally intelligent people won’t set perfection as their target because they know it doesn’t exist. Human beings, by our very nature, are fallible. When perfection is your goal, you’re always left with a nagging sense of failure that makes you want to give up or reduce your effort. You end up spending your time lamenting what you failed to accomplish and what you should have done differently instead of moving forward excited about what you’ve achieved and what you will accomplish in the future.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2 class=\"p4\">4. They focus on solutions<strong><br></strong>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p3 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126339\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Where you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems that you’re facing, you create and prolong negative emotions which hinder self-control. When you focus on the actions you’ll take to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive emotions and improves performance. Emotionally intelligent people won’t dwell on problems because they know they’re most effective when they focus on solutions.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2>5. They avoid asking “what if?”</h2>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126340\" data-article-id=\"297134\" class=\"annotatable\">“What if?” statements throw fuel on the fire of stress and worry, which are detrimental to self-control. Things can go in a million different directions, and the more time you spend worrying about the possibilities, the less time you’ll spend taking action and staying productive (staying productive also happens to calm you down and keep you focused). Productive people know that asking “what if? will only take them to a place they don’t want—or need—to go. Of course, scenario planning is a necessary and effective strategic planning technique. The key distinction here is to recognize the difference between worry and strategic thinking.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2>6. They stay positive</h2>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126341\" data-article-id=\"297134\" class=\"annotatable\">Positive thoughts help you exercise self-control by focusing your brain’s attention onto the rewards you will receive for your effort. You have to give your wandering brain a little help by consciously selecting something positive to think about. Any positive thought will do to refocus your attention. When things are going well, and your mood is good, self-control is relatively easy. When things are going poorly, and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, self-control is a challenge. In these moments, think about your day and identify one positive thing that happened, or will happen, no matter how small. If you can’t think of something from the current day, reflect on the past and look to the future. The point here is that you must have something positive that you’re ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative, so that you don’t lose focus.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2 class=\"p1\">7. They eat</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p2 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126342\" data-article-id=\"297134\">File this one in the counter-intuitive category, especially if you’re having trouble controlling your eating. Your brain burns heavily into your stores of glucose when attempting to exert self-control. If your blood sugar is low, you are far more likely to succumb to destructive impulses. Sugary foods spike your sugar levels quickly and leave you drained and vulnerable to impulsive behavior shortly thereafter. Eating something that provides a slow burn for your body, such as whole grain rice or meat, will give you a longer window of self-control. So, if you’re having trouble keeping yourself out of the company candy bin when you’re hungry, make sure you eat something else if you want to have a fighting chance.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2 class=\"p2\">8. They sleep</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126343\" data-article-id=\"297134\">I’ve beaten this one to death over the years and can’t say enough about the importance of sleep to increasing your emotional intelligence and maintaining your focus and self-control. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day’s memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams), so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don’t get enough—or the right kind—of sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present, which are a major productivity killer. Being busy often makes you feel as if you must sacrifice sleep to stay productive, but sleep deprivation diminishes your productivity so much throughout the day that you’re better off sleeping.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126344\" data-article-id=\"297134\">When you’re tired, your brain’s ability to absorb glucose is greatly diminished. This makes it difficult to control the impulses that derail your focus. What’s more, without enough sleep you are more likely to crave sugary snacks to compensate for low glucose levels. So, if you’re trying to exert self-control over your eating, getting a good night’s sleep—every night—is one of the best moves you can make.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>9. They exercise</strong></h2>\r\n<p class=\"p2 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126345\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a neurotransmitter that makes your brain feel soothed and keeps you in control of your impulses. If you’re having trouble resisting the impulse to walk over to the office next door to let somebody have it, just keep on walking. You should have the impulse under control by the time you get back.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2><strong>10. They meditate</strong></h2>\r\n<p class=\"p2 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126346\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Meditation actually trains your brain to become a self-control machine. Even simple techniques like mindfulness, which involves taking as little as five minutes a day to focus on nothing more than your breathing and your senses, improves your self-awareness and your brain’s ability to resist destructive impulses. Buddhist monks appear calm and in control for a reason. Give it a try.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>11. They ride the wave</strong></h2>\r\n<p class=\"p2 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126347\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Desire and distraction have the tendency to ebb and flow like the tide. When the impulse you need to control is strong, waiting out this wave of desire is usually enough to keep yourself in control. When you feel as if you must give in, the rule of thumb here is to wait at least 10 minutes before succumbing to temptation. You’ll often find that the great wave of desire is now little more than a ripple that you have the power to step right over.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2>12. They squash negative self-talk</h2>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126348\" data-article-id=\"297134\" class=\"annotatable\">A big final step in exercising self-control involves stopping negative self-talk in its tracks. The more you ruminate on negative thoughts, the more power you give them. Most of our negative thoughts are just that—thoughts, not facts. When you find yourself believing the negative and pessimistic things your inner voice says, it’s time to stop and write them down. Literally stop what you’re doing and write down what you’re thinking. Once you’ve taken a moment to slow down the negative momentum of your thoughts, you will be more rational and clear-headed in evaluating their veracity.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126349\" data-article-id=\"297134\" class=\"annotatable\">You can bet that your statements aren’t true any time you use words like “never,” “worst,” “ever,” etc. If your statements still look like facts once they’re on paper, take them to a friend or colleague you trust and see if he or she agrees with you. Then the truth will surely come out. When it feels like something always or never happens, this is just your brain’s natural threat tendency inflating the perceived frequency or severity of an event. Identifying and labeling your thoughts as thoughts by separating them from the facts will help you escape the cycle of negativity and move toward a positive new outlook.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126350\" data-article-id=\"297134\">The important thing to remember is you have to give these strategies the opportunity to work.

The gangly, boyish, and eminently charming actor, best known for playing Marius in 2012’s <i>Les Misérables</i>, is meant to be seated on a plush couch in his inordinately posh Manhattan hotel suite, but he seems incapable of staying put. He frequently springs up to further demonstrate whatever point he’s in the middle of making, and even when he is seated, his deep, throaty voice races headlong out of him, his mouth often tripping over his words.</p>\r\n<p>“I had spaghetti bolognese for lunch, which felt amazing at the time, and then I hit a wall,” he tells BuzzFeed News at the outset of his interview last month. “I have a vat of coffee here, which is propelling me back into form. So hopefully my chat will not stink.”</p>\r\n<p>Redmayne’s infectious verve is, ironically, in service of explaining how he learned to keep his body resolutely stiff and static. With the new film <i>The Theory of Everything</i>, the 32-year-old Redmayne has been winning the <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alisonwillmore/benedict-cumberbatch-vs-eddie-redmayne\">best reviews</a> of his young career, as well as considerable Oscar buzz, for his performance as theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, who has famously spent the vast majority of his career in a wheelchair due to a physically debilitating motor neuron disease similar to ALS. (One typical rave, from <i><a href=\"http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20869525,00.html\">Entertainment Weekly</a></i>: “Redmayne’s astonishing transformation lends a touch of magic to the material.”)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll  \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255800\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-1272-1415928670-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-1272-1415928670-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"293\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 245px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255800','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-1272-1415928670-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Eddie Redmayne in <i>The Theory of Everything</i> </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Liam Daniel / Focus Features</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The film, which is currently playing in New York and Los Angeles and expands into more theaters on Nov. 14, tracks Hawking’s physical decline from his early days as a doctoral candidate at Cambridge. Its main emotional focus, however, is how the disease affected his romance with and eventual marriage to Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), whose memoir served as the basis for the film. Playing Hawking proposed one of the most intimidating challenges imaginable for an actor: Faithfully portraying the physical specificity of Hawking’s disease meant bottling up virtually every tool available to capture his emotional inner life.</p>\r\n<p>But according to <i>The Theory of Everything</i>’s director, James Marsh (<i>Man on Wire</i>), it was a challenge that Redmayne was up to from the moment the two first met to discuss the role. “Eddie’s a very intelligent actor,” Marsh says a few weeks later on the phone. “I was struck by how much he understood the nature of the psychology of the role, and what he had to do is to physically prepare for what then would become an emotional performance. The physicality needed to be in place and embedded, essentially, into his preparation. Once that was in place, then the real work began to bring this character to life emotionally. He understood all that from the get-go.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255075\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr07/longform-2802-1415923114-37.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr07/longform-2802-1415923114-37.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"661\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 613px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:1\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255075','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr07/longform-2802-1415923114-37.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by David J.

(Instead, he studied the history of art at Cambridge.) “I’ve always wondered if at drama school you get given [a] process,” he says. “Every single job I do, whether it’s theater or film, I’m still grappling to find a process. But interestingly, when I got cast in [<i>Theory of Everything</i>], my instinct was to make it quite a formal one.”</p>\r\n<p>Part of that instinct stemmed from his understanding that the practical demands of film production — shooting the film out of sequence — would add yet another layer of complication to the job of capturing Hawking’s physical deterioration. “I had to absolutely map what his physical decline was going to be,” he says. “I wanted to do that with a dancer. … Quite particularly on film, people are a bit scared to ask actors to do [a scene] again. But with dancers, they’re extraordinary artists, and it’s like” — he began clapping his hands — “<i>do it again, do it again, do it again</i> until you get it right. That was the rigor in which I wanted to work — not to compromise. … For Stephen, the disease couldn’t be less important. Like, he has <i>no</i> interest in it,” he continues. “I wanted to make sure that this is not a story of a disease. It’s an unconventional love story. I wanted to be totally free of thinking about what my little finger’s doing to play whatever the emotion was.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_large image_lfrl  \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255816\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr02/longform-14026-1415928784-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr02/longform-14026-1415928784-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"661\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 613px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255816','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr02/longform-14026-1415928784-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones in <i>The Theory of Everything</i> </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Liam Daniel / Focus Features</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To get to that immersive place, Redmayne — as well as his co-star Jones, who also had to discover how best to play a living person — had to become something of a detective mixed with an investigative reporter mixed with a movement artist. “In some ways, it’s being like Sherlock Holmes,” says Jones, sitting in her own nearby hotel suite. “It’s trying to interrogate who this person is and then inhabit them in a truthful way.” After teaming up with dancer-choreographer Alexandra Reynolds (who also worked on <i>World War Z</i>), Redmayne met with doctors, nurses, and patients at the Queen Square Centre for Neuromuscular Disease in London. “They have an ALS clinic every week, and at the end [the doctor] would say, ‘There’s an actor here trying to play Stephen Hawking, would you be interested in meeting him?’” says Redmayne. “And across the board, people were sensationally generous. … Some people would allow me to feel their hands, to feel the weight of their bodies.”</p>\r\n<p>At the clinic, Redmayne also learned about the differences between the loss of “upper” neurons — which causes the affected areas to fix into a rigid shape — and “lower” neurons — which causes the opposite, the body to go loose and limp. But those losses are specific to each person, which meant Redmayne had to sort out — based mostly on archival photos and whatever he could find on YouTube — how Hawking’s motor neuron disease uniquely manifested itself, and when. He then showed those images to the doctors at Queen Square so they could render a loose sort of diagnosis.</p>\r\n<p>After filling an iPad with every scrap of visual and documentary material he collected, Redmayne then created a single, double-sided master list, which charted out the details he’d need to know for every single scene. That list, he says, included “what muscles had gone, where vocally he was at, and then what glasses he was wearing, whether he was on one stick or two sticks, or which wheelchair he was in.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255833\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rubbable-container\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr11/anigif_enhanced-mid-32268-1415928937-2.gif\" width=\"440\" height=\"241\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr11/anigif_enhanced-mid-32268-1415928937-2.gif\" rel:version=\"201411141357\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" alt=\"The Transformation of Eddie Redmayne\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr11/anigif_enhanced-mid-32268-1415928937-2.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Focus Features</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout this process, Redmayne was also working with Reynolds, three days a week, three to four hours a day, in a rehearsal space, to teach his body how to render each stage of Hawking’s decline. “Rather than just replicating positions, it was about when you’re <i>holding</i> these positions,” Redmayne says, as he starts to shrug up his shoulders, and twist and stiffen his hands. “It was almost like internally learning to squash my body, or to be able to manipulate [my] hands in ways that it hadn’t done before.”</p>\r\n<p>One of the trickier elements was mastering an early stage of ALS-related diseases, a phenomenon called “dropped foot,” where the patient’s foot essentially goes limp at the ankle. Redmayne jumps up from the couch to demonstrate. “What happens is you’re not aware it’s happening — your knee just compromises by lifting up a bit more,” he says, lifting up his leg as his foot flops down like a loose flipper. “And that’s all totally fine until one day you’re rushing, and the knee forgets to do that, and you fall.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255094\" rel:buzz_num=\"2\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr07/enhanced-buzz-wide-2500-1415922667-26.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr07/enhanced-buzz-wide-2500-1415922667-26.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"742\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 694px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:2\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255094','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr07/enhanced-buzz-wide-2500-1415922667-26.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by David J.

I could see, of course, what this was doing to him. I would hear so often him breaking out of character. There was this painful kind of moan. And he would let it all out and then get ready for the next take. He never complained.”</p>\r\n<p>When asked if he had a good massage therapist, Redmayne just chuckles. “I had an amazing osteopath, someone who works with hardcore dancers,” he says. “It was a constant thing. And occasionally it was middle-of-the-day emergency acupuncture sessions, a bit of [pain reliever] Nurofen. At moments, it was pretty intense, but the absolute reality was you got to get up every day, out of the chair, and so many of the people that I met couldn’t. And you’re constantly reminded of basically how lucky you are.”</p>\r\n<p>The role didn’t just affect his body, either. Redmayne contorted his face so frequently that the film’s makeup artist noticed the right side of his face began to change — a facial transformation that his co-star believes remains to this day. “I feel like I can still see Stephen in his face, even now,” Jones says. “I can see the character had a profound effect on him. But he’s a true actor. He was obsessive about it. He wanted to play this man with respect, and with <i>absolute</i> truthfulness.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_small image_lfrs  \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255843\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-18286-1415929030-11.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-18286-1415929030-11.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"263\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 215px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255843','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-18286-1415929030-11.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Redmayne and Jones in <i>The Theory of Everything</i> </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Focus Features</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That dedication was most evident in Redmayne’s determination to capture Hawking’s voice — his actual voice, before a tracheotomy forced him to speak through a computer. “When I met Stephen, he asked if I was playing him before the voice machine, and I said yes,” says Redmayne. “And he said, ‘Well, my voice was very slurred.’ At that point in the script, it didn’t go to the point of incomprehensibility. But the only documentary footage there is of him speaking, he is completely incomprehensible. His students would have to come and spend two weeks learning to lip-read him and understand him.”</p>\r\n<p>Redmayne pressed Marsh and screenwriter Anthony McCarten to include Hawking’s completely slurred speech in the film — but the film’s producers balked at having one of their lead actors be totally unintelligible to the audience.</p>\r\n<p>“We couldn’t subtitle it,” says Marsh. “That felt somehow wrong. So Eddie very graciously took a step back from the truth of what he found out, and we found a kind compromise for the film. I don’t think he ever was very comfortable with it, nor was I. But I could see why the producers were wanting something that was just a bit more comprehensible. That’s an example where we did end up compromising, I think, against my nature and I think against Eddie’s nature. But I don’t regret that; I think the film still feels very truthful in the realm of the illness.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255110\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-20395-1415922812-19.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-20395-1415922812-19.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"647\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 599px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255110','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-20395-1415922812-19.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Liam Daniel / Focus Features</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>However taxing depicting Hawking’s illness was — and it also included everything from mastering driving Hawking’s different wheelchairs, to subtly changing his wardrobe to make his body seem slighter as he grew older — it was still only half the job.

For that, he relied especially on Marsh and Jones. <i>The Theory of Everything</i> spends just as much time exploring Jane Hawking’s life as it does Stephen’s, and how all-consuming it became for her to care for her husband. “I remember being in a rehearsal room with Eddie, and Eddie’s in the chair, and then suddenly you feel as the person playing the carer you have this enormous responsibility,” Jones says. “At a certain point, Stephen couldn’t just lift up a spoon. So Jane’s got to be there doing it for him. So suddenly, I was like, <i>Gosh, I’ve got to be the responsible one in this situation!</i> She was Stephen’s movement in the world.”</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, the circumstances of their characters put a great deal of literal and figurative weight on Jones’ shoulders. “Normally, when you arrive on a film set each morning, you’re like, ‘OK, we’re going to shoot the scene here,’” says Redmayne. “James will have an opinion. Then maybe Felicity will say, ‘Actually, maybe I’ll try it in this seat.’ You’re playing with ideas. But virtually every single day on this, I’d be like, ‘I can’t do that. I can’t move from here.’ She has to do all the heavy lifting — a lot of it, as far as keeping the energy in scenes. It was really complicated. She was a sensational friend throughout it.”</p>\r\n<p>Before filming, Jones and Redmayne knew each other from their earlier work during Michael Grandage’s tenure overseeing the Donmar Warehouse Theatre in London, but they only really became “great friends,” as Redmayne puts it, while making the film. That friendship was sealed very early in the production during a scene in which, after learning of his diagnosis, Jane pushes a deeply depressed Stephen to play croquet with her — only to be quietly devastated when she sees just how physically debilitated he’d already become. “He’s setting up a challenge, isn’t he?” says Jones. “He’s saying, ‘This isn’t going to be easy.’ It’s totally a test. And he’s saying if you can get through this, then maybe we can spend our lives together.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll  \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255860\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr08/longform-1674-1415929166-24.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr08/longform-1674-1415929166-24.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"425\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 377px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255860','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr08/longform-1674-1415929166-24.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Jones and Redmayne in the croquet scene in <i>The Theory of Everything</i> </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Liam Daniel / Focus Features</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It became a kind of test for Jones and Redmayne, as well, after Redmayne asked Jones to tease him off camera when it was time for him to shoot Stephen struggling to play croquet. “That takes great trust, because she basically sort of started in,” he says, laughing. “And she knew where to hit me. I think the crew were all going, ‘This is day two, and they <i>hate</i> each other!’”</p>\r\n<p>Marsh, for his part, was delighted. “Stephen is really angry at this point,” he says. “He’s angry at himself, he’s angry at the illness, he’s angry at Jane. He’s angry at this totally fucked up situation he’s in. He has to show that. Felicity began to taunt him, and he began to respond to it, and it just got very interesting. It was one those important moments in the film where you knew the actors were going to work for each other and off of each other and help each other, even though it felt like it was kind of cruel to be mocking someone as she was doing. But it was very helpful to the performance. They began to do this several times in the film. There would be off-camera provocations — or encouragements. That’s a very good example of actors trusting their instincts and doing things that aren’t in the script or aren’t being asked for.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255123\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-21653-1415922992-13.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-21653-1415922992-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"830\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 782px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255123','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-21653-1415922992-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by David J.

It’s her birthday — she’s leaving for the evening, and wants to say good-bye to her co-star and friend. Immediately, Redmayne leaps up, grabs a glass, and bursts into a boisterous rendition of “Happy Birthday.” (The second plate of cake and third glass of champagne, by the way, is for the BuzzFeed News reporter in the room, which is both enormously kind and incredibly savvy PR.)</p>\r\n<p>“When will I see you?” says Redmayne, swaying back and forth and sipping his champagne. “Tomorrow?

Are you having fun?”</p>\r\n<p>After Jones has left (“I decided to go really low-key and just see one of my best friends,” she says of her birthday plans), Redmayne returns to his couch, champagne in hand. Asked what it was like to learn that Stephen Hawking had enjoyed the film — and the profound effort that went into his performance — for the first time that afternoon he grows quiet, his words coming slowly, his body still. “It means everything, really,” he says, his voice heavy with emotion. “The weight of those high stakes had been sitting on my shoulders for an age, and — that’s why we’re telling the story, because he’s an extraordinary human being, as is Jane. They allowed us into their orbit for a few months, and that was one of the great privileges of my life.

I didn’t mean to scare you!”</p>\n<p>That’s the first thing Connie Britton said on national television, way back in 1996. It was a fitting introduction to her character, Nikki Faber, on the long-running ABC show <i>Spin City</i>, in which she played the sometimes raunchy, oversexed love interest to Michael J. Fox as they attempted to manage the publicity of the bumbling New York City mayor.</p>\n<p>The character on <i>Spin City</i> has Britton’s face, but the rest is nearly unrecognizable: Her hair is shorter, browner, and cut in the choppy layers that anyone familiar with the ‘90s will recognize as “The Rachel.” Nikki is a classic man-eater: She alludes to threesomes, she towers her co-stars, she’s coarse and vulgar when the rest of the women in the office come off as sweet or clueless. It’s a choice role (especially for a relative newcomer), but it’s also completely at odds with the way we think of Connie Britton today.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_large image_lfrl no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3505101_4213306\" rel:buzz_num=\"22\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/9/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4138-1415544342-5.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/9/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4138-1415544342-5.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"293\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 245px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:22\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4213306','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/9/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4138-1415544342-5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Dreamworks SKG / Courtesy Everett Collection</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Because Nikki Faber is no Tami Taylor. Tami Taylor — she of the “y’all” and the hair and the aviators, of the soft exterior and steely drive, of infinite wisdom and ageless beauty. No matter that <i>Friday Night Lights</i> was one of the lowest rated and most beleaguered network shows in recent memory: Through the magic cultural catch-up tool that is Netflix, Taylor has taken on the sort of iconic importance usually reserved for massive Hollywood stars’ roles. If <i>Friday Night Lights</i> and its brand of thoughtful, empathetic, addictive drama has morphed into a quasi-religion, then Tami Taylor is its patron saint, the complicated embodiment of all that made the show feel different and real and smart.</p>\n<p>The character of Tami Taylor lived for 76 episodes and five seasons — long enough for her character to subsume the actress who played her. Even in her subsequent starring roles in <i>American Horror Story</i> and <i>Nashville</i> feel like she’s just following a different path on the Tami Taylor Choose Your Adventure novel: In one, her marriage falls apart and she ends up having sex with a man in a rubber suit; in another, she becomes a famous country singer with a complicated love life. But the center — the Tami Taylor-ified charisma, the waterfall of hair, and the “I’m concerned about you, do we need to have a talk” face — remains.</p>\n<p>The fortitude and consistency of that center has fostered an adult cult of Connie Britton: a mass of women, mostly between the ages of 20 and 45, who view Britton not just with affection, or awe, but admiration. Every star has fans, but select few have cults. We often associate the word “cult” with mindless, manipulated masses, but the word also connotes a group whose beliefs are in some way deviant or different. If Britton had become a star during those <i>Spin City</i> years, there’d be nothing cultish about loving her: Like so many other sitcom stars, she was somewhere around 30, thin, white, beautiful, straight.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212612\" rel:buzz_num=\"17\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3505101_4212612\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212612\"}}' rel:description=\"Loving the Britton of today is tantamount to ignoring much of what Hollywood has tried to impute as ideal.\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:17\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3505101_4212612\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212612\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:17\" rel:count=\"2\"></a>\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"white_pullquote\" style=\"font-family: 'Quicksand'; font-weight: regular; line-height: 1.1em; font-size: 36px; color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF; \">Loving the Britton of today is tantamount to ignoring much of what Hollywood has tried to impute as ideal.</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>But loving the Britton of today is tantamount to ignoring much of what Hollywood has tried to impute as ideal. She’s still thin, white, beautiful, and straight, but she’s the thing that the vast majority of mainstream media pretends doesn’t exist: a woman over 40. More specifically, a woman over 40 whose image combines the sexual <i>and</i> the maternal, the ambitious <i>and</i> the empathetic. As one fan of the hundreds who, when solicited, offered testimonials about why they loved Britton told me, “She makes getting older seem incredibly appealing — not just because she looks stunning, but it’s the sense of presence and surety she projects.” The combination of confidence and beauty, of wisdom and maturity — that’s what undergirds her fandom.</p>\n<p>At this moment, the seeming singularity of Connie Britton, and the magnitude of the affection directed toward her, bespeaks a generalized hunger for a female star that models a nuanced, mature, and periodically imperfect form of femininity. It’s about the hair, of course — which has taken on a near totemic function — but it’s also about much more than that.</p>\n<p>Britton is by no means the biggest star in Hollywood: <i>Nashville</i> is limping through its third season, and she was on screen for all of 10 minutes in her most recent film, <i>This Is Where I Leave You</i>. But if you look closely, she might be one of the most important. Hollywood didn’t make Connie Britton a star, cobbling together the most reductive and regressive notions of what it means to be a woman today. We did, forging her in the most hopeful and realistic yet strong versions of our best selves.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212500\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-25731-1415572485-11.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-25731-1415572485-11.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1013\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 965px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4212500','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-25731-1415572485-11.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Tommaso Boddi / Getty</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The narrative of Britton’s early career has been recited in the various profiles of her post-<i>Friday Night Lights</i> fame. She grew up fairly WASP-y in Maryland and Virginia, went to Dartmouth, majored in Asian Studies, studied abroad with (now Sen.) Kirsten Gillibrand. She’d been involved in theater in high school and, after graduating from college, moved to New York and married her college boyfriend, and while he became a finance banker, she dabbled in off-off-Broadway productions while taking part-time jobs to help pay the bills, including one as an aerobics instructor, leg warmers and all. (Britton declined to be interviewed for this story.)</p>\n<p>Britton and the finance husband divorced in 1995, but at that point she had spent eight months shooting the film that would put her, however briefly, on the map as the frustrated wife of an adulterous man in Ed Burns’ debut feature, <i>The Brothers McMullen</i>, a small character study with a tiny budget that went on to win the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance.</p>\n<p><i>McMullen</i> didn’t make Britton a household name, but it did put her on casting directors’ radar, which is how she nearly won the <i>Jerry Maguire</i> role that eventually went to Renee Zellweger.</p>\n<p>Two paths diverged in a Hollywood casting room: One star (Zellweger) became a household name, while the other went on to a string of sitcoms. The <i>Maguire</i> role would have made Britton into a late-‘90s It Girl, but one look at the current state of Zellweger’s career — and the current uproar over daring to age and/or her resistance to it — and you can see why Britton should be thankful to have missed the chance to make out with Tom Cruise.</p>\n<p>Instead of <i>Maguire</i>, Britton found herself cast in a slew of doomed pilots and in a multi-episode stint on the original <i>Ellen</i> as the overbearing, clueless sister of one of Ellen’s best friends, and eventually landed the role of Nikki on <i>Spin City</i>, where she would win the sort of quiet following that often follows supporting sitcom characters.</p>\n<p>But when Fox’s Parkinson’s disease forced him to leave <i>Spin City</i> in 2000, Britton’s character was written off the show. For the next six years, she jumped from one small role to the next, sometimes picking up a recurring gig, as she did in <i>The West Wing</i>, other times ending up a piece of ‘80s-costumed window dressing, as she did in the film adaptation of Buzz Bissinger’s <i>Friday Night Lights</i> in 2004. It was an exhausting, frustrating schlep between sets and roles and disappointments.</p>\n<p>In 2006, Peter Berg, who had produced the film version of <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, was working on a television adaptation for NBC that would be far more loosely based on the real-life events collected in Bissinger’s book. He asked Britton to reprise the same role she had played in the film, promising that this time, her role would be more fleshed out. “I was really, really hesitant,” Britton told <i>Variety.</i> “In fact, I said, ‘No. I love you and adore you, but I don’t want to.’”</p>\n<p>Yet Berg reiterated his promise for something bigger and meatier than a meekly supportive coach’s wife — and it was that role, as guidance counselor, mother, wife, and eventually principal, that would, over the course of five seasons, turn Connie Britton into the household name that she nearly became more than a decade before. She wasn’t a buxom young starlet or the hottest new thing; she was just, quite simply and clearly, one of television’s best actresses in one of its most complicated roles.</p>\n<p>The details of Britton’s struggle ultimately matter less than the sheer fact of a woman breaking through in Hollywood at the age of 39. But that’s just one of the qualities of Britton’s image that have made it so pervasively popular over the last eight years. For men and women alike, she exudes what feels like an amorphous, complex feminine aura. But ask any woman to tease that apart and you’ll see it’s an amalgamation of several interlocking areas: softness, maturity, progressiveness, and a particular take on “having it all.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212371\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/0/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-306-1415509225-16.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/0/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-306-1415509225-16.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 852px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4212371','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/0/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-306-1415509225-16.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Michael Loccisano / Getty</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The “softness” isn’t to do with Britton’s body — which is pilates-toned, but by no means a size zero — so much as her demeanor. And the way we understand Britton’s demeanor is as an extension of Tami Taylor, who spent five seasons negotiating her way to power from the stereotypically subservient position of “coach’s wife” in a football-obsessed town.</p>\n<p>Instead of forcefully critiquing the cultural infrastructure from the outside, she works within its existing boundaries to change it. Her beauty, her smile, that nice-lady voice, all of it is a way of getting what she/the high school students she counsels want or need, especially when dealing with apparatuses of power (the boosters, the school board, Joe McCoy). She kills not with kindness, but with <a href=\"http://https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=vihYkEAQ_DY\">y’alls</a>.</p>\n<p>Tami’s power is negotiated, but it’s also a realistic rendering of how women in much of America are able to fight and win battles on a daily basis. Instead of busting balls, attempting to engage in conversation. Instead of insulting another’s way of life, trying to inhabit it. Tami’s mix of the soft Southern exterior with steely drive emulates a form of activism wholly recognizable to anyone who’s attempted to effect change in an environment wholly resistant to it.</p>\n<p>That Tami Taylor brand of softness is replicated in Britton’s off-screen persona. No matter that Britton isn’t exactly a native Southerner: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/conniebritton\">Her Twitter account</a> is littered with y’alls. Which isn’t to suggest that Britton is performing “softness”; rather, it’s become a naturally accentuated component of her public persona. It’s amplified every time an interviewer asks her to recreate the “magic” of Tami Taylor — getting her to don Taylor’s signature aviators, for example — and underlined in her leading role in <i>Nashville</i>, in which she might say fewer “y’alls” but still embraces the same model of conciliatory power and strength, this time with more glitter and halter tops. The softness — and its power to persuade — endures. And of course, on screen and off, with its soft waves, its welcoming caramel color, there’s the hair.</p>\n<p>When people talk about Britton, the first thing they talk about is the hair. Even in professional interviews, journalists ask her about it. Seth Meyers pegged <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj7nBKUXg8\">an entire segment</a> to it. The Britton cover story in <i>More</i> magazine begins with, “The hair is tawny, thick, and tousled to casual perfection. And it’s all her own.” <i>American Horror Story</i> showrunner Ryan Murphy says, “She has the best hair in Hollywood.” And then there’s the hair-supported <a href=\"about:blank\">Tumblr</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConBritsHair\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.birchbox.com/magazine/video/how-to-connie-britton-waves\">the</a> <a href=\"http://www.today.com/style/connie-britton-hair-how-to-tutorial-hairstyle-I535890\">endless</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvt3QU7Z-8k\">tutorials</a>.</p>\n<p>The hair connotes softness, but it also suggests a sort of unfettered, unabashed womanliness. It’s not just the volume — although that’s part of it — or the beautiful color. It’s not even the hair itself so much as what it’s not: namely, the stereotypical haircut of a fortysomething mother, doomed to the next four decades of practical mom-cuts.</p>\n<p>As cultural critics Sarah Blackwood and Sarah Mesle <a href=\"http://avidly.lareviewofbooks.org/2012/10/16/on-connie-brittons-hair/\">put it</a>, “The Hair asks us to think about a heavy ponytail at 40. Let’s not dismiss this as a joke, or as the same question as Botox or artificially plumped lips. If Botox is always about youth obsession, Connie Britton’s Hair is not always — or even ever — an attempt to look like Lyla Garrity or Hayden Panettiere. It might actually be about the specific pleasure of forty-ness.”</p>\n<p>The utter fullness of the hair is like a testament to a life well-lived. The strawberry blonde highlights suggest a life spent in the sun; its ability to swing in a ponytail, to rope up in a French twist, tousle around the shoulders, even to look just this side of <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jbf%20hair\">J.B.F</a>., is like an extension of all the modes of femininity occupied by today’s accomplished woman.</p>\n<p>Britton’s hair refuses to hew the line of what a woman’s hair (or life) should resemble. It’s not unruly the way that, say, Helena Bonham Carter’s hair is — but it declares, through its sheer existence, a different self-conception for a woman over 40 than those proffered by the media. The hair, in other words, feels like a revelation.</p>\n<p>But if we’re talking about Connie Britton’s hair, we’re also talking about the way it complements her face. Usually people say that a face “betrays” one’s age, but Britton’s face functions as the opposite of betrayal: Each smile line and crow’s-foot makes her somehow more, not <i>less</i>, beautiful. She’s not old; she’s <i>mature</i>. And with that maturity comes a certain wisdom: the ability, for example, to discuss big, often alienating issues with grace and empathy, whether it’s talking to her teenage daughter about losing her virginity (<i>Friday Night Lights</i>) or figuring out how to admit that her marriage is over (<i>Nashville</i>).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212609\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3505101_4212609\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212609\"}}' rel:description=\"Usually male stars are the ones who grow into their looks — see George Clooney, Jon Hamm, even Cary Grant.\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:16\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-twitter-share fa fa-twitter\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"twitter3505101_4212609\" rel:via=\"annehelen\" rel:sub_title=\"Usually%20male%20stars%20are%20the%20ones%20who%20grow%20into%20their%20looks%20—\" rel:adtl_tweet_text=\" \" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"tw-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212609\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/list-item:16\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3505101_4212609\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212609\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:16\" rel:count=\"5\"></a>\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"white_pullquote\" style=\"font-family: 'Quicksand'; font-weight: regular; line-height: 1.1em; font-size: 36px; color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF; \">Usually male stars are the ones who grow into their looks — see George Clooney, Jon Hamm, even Cary Grant.</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>It’s no coincidence that Britton worked in Hollywood for decades before breaking through. She was always beautiful, but it wasn’t until she looked the way she does now that beauty became one of her defining adjectives. Usually male stars are the ones who grow into their looks — see George Clooney, Jon Hamm, even Cary Grant — but most female stars peak and often became hyperreal versions of their former selves, an amalgam of precise surgery and injections.</p>\n<p>In this way, Britton’s refusal to transform her face becomes an act of rebellion against a system of norms that would rather she freeze all movement above her eyebrows than have a visible wrinkle. But Britton has also consciously refused to bend her narrative into that of a woman obsessed with her own aging. As she told <i>Esquire</i>, “I haven’t really focused on myself as a quote-unquote ‘woman maturing.’ I try to avoid that at all costs. … Some of the press that happened around <i>Nashville</i> really was an eye-opener for me, because there were a lot of initial stories describing my character as ‘aging’ and ‘over the hill,’ and I was like, ‘What the fuck?’”</p>\n<p>Originally, Britton’s <i>Nashville</i> character was framed as the aging has-been to Hayden Panettiere’s Taylor Swift-esque ingenue, but Britton hated the dichotomy. She fought the writers to cut scenes, like one planned for the premiere, in which she did the stereotypical pull-at-your-face-and-look-sad routine. She was “furious” about the trajectory of her character, especially, as Britton explained, given what had recently happened in her own career: “That’s not even who I represent as an actor,” she <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/connie-britton-is-a-late-bloomer.html?pagewanted=all\">told</a> the <i>New York Times.</i> “My life started being awesome five years ago.”</p>\n<p>To admit that life can, indeed, start to be awesome at 40 — that’s a great quote. But it also exemplifies the sort of ideological rebellion that crystallizes the cult around her.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212435\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25154-1415572512-13.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25154-1415572512-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1013\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 965px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4212435','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25154-1415572512-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Jonathan Leibson / Getty</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>In <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, we never know how Eric and Tami Taylor vote. We can safely assume that the rest of their small Texas town almost certainly votes Republican, but the narrative never hinges on questions of political affinity. Rather, it divides on lines of haves and have-nots, of who advocates for which side and with what motivation. Tami Taylor might not label herself a liberal, but she’s an unequivocal progressive, working on the micro scale to rectify macro-level divisions of class, race, and gender.</p>\n<p>The most prominent example manifests in the form of Taylor’s counsel to Becky, a 16-year-old who becomes pregnant the first time she has sex. When Becky asks Tami how she’d advise her own daughter in the same situation, Tami’s response is a master class in ethical counsel: “I would tell her to think about her life, think about what’s important to her and what she wants, and I would tell her that she’s in a real tough spot, and then I would support whatever decision she made.”</p>\n<p>The episode received a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/10/arts/television/10lights.html\">significant</a> <a href=\"http://feministing.com/2010/07/12/friday-night-lights-takes-on-abortion/\">amount</a> <a href=\"http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2010/02/04/friday-night-lights-abortion-plotline-mustsee-tv/\">of</a> <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/07/friday-night-lights-tackles-abortion/59495/\">attention</a>, in part because it was the first to directly address abortion on broadcast television since, well, <i>Maude,</i> nearly three decades before. But it’s but one of dozens of ways in which Taylor’s character models a progressive social view: the way she advocates for, and achieves, an equal partnership with her husband; her handling of the revelation of the mayor’s lesbianism; the best sex talk in television history; her overarching and persistent advocacy for Tyra in all parts of her life. You could say that Tami’s just doing her job as a guidance counselor, but she’s doing her job in a deeply humanistic way that’s implicitly, if not explicitly, in line with the aims of social justice.</p>\n<p>Tami is outspoken and candid, never didactic or preachy. It’s the way, really, so many of us imagine our best activist selves: not as actors in some hyperpoliticized arena, but as good people helping and doing and advising not because of some overarching ideology, but because it seems right.</p>\n<p>If Tami Taylor is the primary narrative agent of social justice in <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, then it makes sense that the aura of progressivism clings to Britton’s image outside of <i>Friday Night Lights</i>. But Britton’s own actions have only strengthened the conflation of Taylor’s work with her “real-life” beliefs. When the Mitt Romney campaign started using the <i>Friday Night Lights</i> catchphrase “Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can’t Lose,” Britton shot back, penning an <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2012/10/28/women-birth-control-friday-night-lights/1663895/\">editorial</a> for <i>USA Today</i> arguing that Romney’s stance on birth control was counter to the central tenets of <i>Friday Night Lights.</i> During Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis’ filibuster to block a restrictive antiabortion bill, Britton not only proclaimed her support, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/connie-britton-lisa-edelstein-support-578118\">but released a limited-edition T-shirt</a> inscribed with “What Would Tami Taylor Do?” (<a href=\"http://standwithtexaswomen.org\">standwithtexaswomen.org</a> on the back) with all proceeds directed to Planned Parenthood.</p>\n<p>Britton, like Taylor — and like the stated doctrine of Planned Parenthood — is not advocating for abortion, but for <i>choice</i>. But even that sort of advocacy would be too much of a polarizing issue for most celebrities to touch. It’s OK to support a political candidate, but a divisive issue like abortion, that’s something else entirely.</p>\n<p>But if Britton’s willingness to attach herself to the issue of reproductive rights might have alienated a minority of fans, it served to fortify the support of the majority and solidify the cult. Even as it’s become increasingly accepted for celebrities to identify as feminists, few speak specifically about what that means, in action — in part, of course, to avoid losing fans or potential projects. Britton’s vocal support of feminist candidates and causes makes her advocacy seem less strategic, performative, or planned and more of an extension of a “true” self and belief system.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212608\" rel:buzz_num=\"15\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19629-1415572543-25.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19629-1415572543-25.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1013\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 965px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:15\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4212608','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19629-1415572543-25.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Rick Diamond / Getty</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>For a woman to “have it all,” she must, in some vague, unspecific terms, manage to simultaneously satisfy her boss, her children, and her partner; then, and only then, can she can be satisfied herself. And beautiful, and adhering to generalized body norms, and emotionally and spiritually fulfilled. As many have argued, “having it all” is just the ideal set forth by a postfeminist ideology in which all women should be all things to all people, with little mind to how it negates and evacuates the self.</p>\n<p>Britton’s image, with its resounding echoes of Tami Taylor, offers a different take on the “have it all” scenario. As one half of what has been called “<a href=\"http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/04/11/greatest-tv-couple-staff-pick-friday-night-lights/\">the greatest TV couple of all time</a>” and “<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/02/friday-night-lights-finale-how-the-best-marriage-on-tv-was-created/70996/\">the best marriage on television</a>,” Britton — along with co-star Kyle Chandler — models a relationship that’s an actual partnership. It’s imperfect, it’s filled with strife, but unlike most television dramas, which pivot on the question of when and how a couple will end up cheating on each other, Britton and Chandler decided that potential infidelity would never be the guiding question of their on-screen relationship.</p>\n<p>Rather, the narrative focuses on how two ambitious, focused individuals do their best to keep loving each other — and their daughters — and still do the things that make them feel like worthwhile, accomplished humans. It’s never perfect: The house is never clean, Baby Gracie is often lugged around in confusion, teenage Julie is pissed a lot, and there is a modicum of white wine in every episode, but it feels like a lived-in, loving partnership, something to which a couple can aspire, rather than a way of judging their deficiencies. And the message of the series finale — in which Tami tells Eric that it’s her turn to let her career guide the trajectory of their lives — is also the most radical way for a show about a football team to wrap up, ever, the end.</p>\n<p>The “having it all” of <i>FNL</i> is having some of all the things that matter to you, and finding value and validation in doing the best you’re able at those chosen things. You see the same philosophy modeled in <i>Nashville</i>, in which Britton’s character manages to juggle a career, two daughters, a collapsing marriage, an alcoholic love-of-her-life, and multiple new suitors, while also serving as a mentor to younger artists and starting her own record label. Rayna James doesn’t do any of those things perfectly, but she does them — and refuses to apologize for that seeming lack of perfection.</p>\n<p>At the heart of both characters is a complexity, and an eagerness to balance a multiplicity of identities, that Britton herself has pushed for. On <i>Friday Nights Lights,</i> her attention to her character’s trajectory was described as “rabid”; for her turn in <i>This Is Where I Leave You</i>, she refused to allow the role of a woman dating a man two decades her junior to degenerate into that of a “cougar.” When <i>Fast Company</i> <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3009149/most-creative-people-2013/13-connie-britton\">named</a> her as No. 13 of the “100 Most Creative People In Business,” she outlined the strategy she’s adopted for “owning” a character: With each script, she goes through the dialogue line by line, working with <i>Nashville</i> showrunner Callie Khouri to identify “lines that don’t feel right” for the character of Rayna.</p>\n<p>It’s not difficult to understand, then, why so many ambitious women find themselves drawn to Britton and the women she’s played on screen: As one fan explained to me, “Tami and Rayna totally captivate me because they’re each deeply OK with themselves, and that’s the source of their power.”</p>\n<p>That sort of deep “OK-ness” extends to Britton’s personal life, in which she’s balanced a career with the duties of single motherhood (she adopted a son, Yobi, from Ethiopia in 2011), advocacy, and even sex. Friend and producer Sarah Aubrey <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/connie-britton-is-a-late-bloomer.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">told</a> the <i>New York</i> <i>Times</i> magazine that “in my experience of watching Connie Britton’s dating life, it has not been Connie getting beaten out by 25-year-old girls, let’s leave it at that.” Or, in Britton’s words, “Let’s put it this way: The older you get, the easier it is to date younger men. There are more of them.” Britton’s been linked with comedian Jason Mantzoukas, but unlike contemporaries Jennifer Aniston or Cameron Diaz, whose love lives play out in the headlines, framed as fruitless searches for domestic bliss, Britton has kept her love life (and, presumably, really hot younger boyfriends) out of the limelight.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Britton acknowledges how difficult single parenthood is — but also how privileged she is to have assistance. “Our hours [as actors] are long,” Britton <a href=\"http://www.redbookmag.com/fun-contests/celebrity/connie-britton-interview#slide-1\">told</a> <i>Redbook</i>, “but I would never compare what I do with what anyone else does. Everybody’s working hard and doing the best they can — if you’re a mom, there’s that pressure, we all face it. I’m constantly being pulled in different directions. But that’s the thing: Moms are pulled and distracted. I would never say it’s worse for me because I’m an actor.”</p>\n<p>That frankness — about the challenges of being a mother, but also the privileges and the desire and how to make it work with her life — is what not only distinguishes Britton’s image, but makes it meaningful to so many women.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212647\" rel:buzz_num=\"21\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rubbable-container\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/1/tmp/webdr12/anigif_mobile_cdc830fcd8c88ce0d5564b17ab78778a-19.gif\" width=\"625\" height=\"241\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/1/tmp/webdr12/anigif_mobile_cdc830fcd8c88ce0d5564b17ab78778a-19.gif\" rel:version=\"201411141357\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" alt=\"The Cult of Connie Britton\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/1/enhanced/webdr12/anigif_enhanced-mid-30924-1415515869-20.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Britton isn’t a movie star — and it seems very unlikely she will become one. There’s a reason her most memorable roles are on television; why the most indelible vision of her isn’t on the front of a magazine, but in the <i>Friday Night Lights</i> opening credits, with her hair pulled haphazardly up, in a cotton T-shirt, raising her hands in the air in a dance-like victory. She could be your own mom, or sister, or best friend, proclaiming some small life victory in your own little kitchen after a glass of wine at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>With a liberal arts education and a thoroughly middle-class upbringing, Britton’s image resonates most with women whose trajectories are similar: On and off <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, she may be advocating for those who don’t enjoy the same privilege as she does, but the cult of Britton does skew toward those who are educated, middle class, and white. Which isn’t to suggest that this is Britton’s “fault” — her race, class, and educational background were in place long before she became a star — so much as to underline that Britton resonates with a particular demographic that, uncoincidentally, makes up a significant percentage of people who are sharing things on social media.</p>\n<p>This sort of highly specific popularity is the new normal: Instead of a common group of Hollywood stars and prominent public figures who function as de facto models for everyone, the fragmentation of the American entertainment industry has birthed more, not fewer, idols. The internet has facilitated the elevation of the weird, the unique, and those who speak specifically to groups of people who feel that no other mainstream idol could.</p>\n<p>Stardom scholar Richard Dyer <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Heavenly_Bodies.html?id=oUJ0Qbse7lYC\">claimed</a> that “stars matter because they act out aspects of life that matter to us; and performers get to be stars when what they act out matters to enough people.” Connie Britton can’t be a star, then, because what she acts out — the possibility of beauty and vibrancy and sexuality over 40, unabashed advocacy and engaged feminist action — doesn’t yet matter to enough people.</p>\n<p>The adult cult of Connie Britton is vocal and visible, but it’s still a fringe fandom. But the history of stardom is littered with actors whose importance didn’t become clear until years after their tenure, especially unruly, feminist ones like Katharine Hepburn, who was famously labeled “box office poison” in 1939, only to the next four decades slowly turning herself into an icon. But along with stars like Angelina Jolie, who has made it her mission <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/angelina-jolies-perfect-game\">to offer a different blueprint</a> for how to wield power and influence in Hollywood, Britton is fundamentally challenging the polished, safe, postfeminist vision of female stardom that currently dominates so much of the Hollywood landscape. And that’s something like progress, y’all.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3505101_4207834\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Want to read more stories like this?

Here, in this quiet set of cinder block buildings amid the wilderness of Angeles National Forest, was a chance to be treated like a human being.</p>\r\n<p>“It’s a little bit — not freedom, but you can move a little bit,” he told me a few weeks later.</p>\r\n<p>In order to remain and enjoy the perks of this summer camp–style prison, and in order to get the good-time credits that would allow him to serve only 35% of his seven-year sentence, he would need to stay in shape, remain on his best behavior, and summon all of his courage to do hard labor beside thousand-degree flames. He’d made it this far, through months of training behind Pitchess Detention Center, the guards checking his ass for stolen tools every night as he came back into the dorms. When he got to a real fire, when he felt its heat, would he find that he didn’t have what it took?</p>\r\n<p>About half of the people fighting wildland fires on the ground for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) are incarcerated: over 4,400 prisoners, housed at 42 inmate fire camps, including three for women. Together, says Capt. Jorge Santana, the California Department of Corrections &amp; Rehabilitation (CDCR) liaison who supervises the camps, they save the state over $1 billion a year. This year, California has had <a href=\"http://cdfdata.fire.ca.gov/incidents/incidents_stats?year=2014\">over 5,300 wildfires,</a> which is about 700 more than had occurred by this time in 2013, and a thousand more than the five-year average. Now, as the West is coming to the end of one of the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/10/22/358096112/coping-in-a-drier-world-californias-drought-survival-strategy\">driest</a>, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-warmest-year-california-heat-20140917-story.html\">hottest</a> years in recorded history, the work of inmate firefighters has become essential to California’s financial and environmental health.</p>\r\n<p>Someone called Barr’s name and directed him into a closet marked Evidence Room, where a guard handed him a black sign and took his photograph from behind a beige console housing an ancient PC. And then there he was on the screen: 6 feet 2 inches and sullen, with a big, soft face and an overgrown goatee.</p>\r\n<p>“What’s your CDC number?” the guard asked him. “What’s your date of birth? Where else have you done time? When are you going home?”</p>\r\n<p>As long as he didn’t mess this thing up, didn’t get “rolled up,” as inmate firefighters call getting sent back to a walled institution, he’d be released in a little over a year, on Nov. 30, 2014. And he didn’t want to go back to drug dealing when he did. “I’m getting close to 40. I don’t have another one in me,” he explained to me. It was his second conviction, and a third conviction for sales in California would put him away for life. “Evidently, it’s not working, so I have to try something else.”</p>\r\n<p>At the fire camp, the questions continued: “While incarcerated have you ever been involved in a sexually related assault? Do you have any gang affiliation? Any other moniker besides your name? Any mental health concerns?”</p>\r\n<p>Barr gave the answers they wanted, and the man gave him his new identity on a small plastic card. He understood why they had to ask, even if almost no one told the truth. He knew this place was too dangerous for gangs. Turn against one another, lose trust in your crewmates, and you might not survive the next fire.</p>\r\n<p>Just as undeniable changes to the climate have made Cal Fire’s role even more crucial, its dirt-cheap supply of labor is being threatened, as the first trickles of a national movement toward prison reform arrive in California. Fire camps like Holton are supposed to accept only well-behaved inmates with no history of violence, arson, or sex crimes, and so most prisoner firefighters are, like Barr, serving time for low-level offenses, especially drug sales.</p>\r\n<p>With a <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2014/04/02/americas-new-drug-policy-landscape/\">majority</a> of Americans now questioning whether it is humane or economically sound to keep nonviolent drug offenders, who pose little or no threat to public safety, locked up for extended periods, the exact population of trustworthy inmates devoting their incarceration to wildfire protection has started finding its way back onto the streets much sooner. Because if we can trust guys like Barr on the front lines of a fire with a chainsaw or an axe, should they really be locked up for so long in the first place? At a time when a program like this has never been more necessary, its future has never been more in question.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143129\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20330-1414693569-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20330-1414693569-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1064\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1016px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143129','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20330-1414693569-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Chris Tuite for BuzzFeed</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There is nothing new about putting prisoners to work to cover the cost of their stay. As far back as the 12th century, during the reign of King Henry II, Britain’s private jail operators leased their prisoners out as daily workers to whoever could pay a rate higher than what it cost to give the inmates the food, water, and shelter necessary to survive.</p>\r\n<p>In the 18th century, most criminals in America were punished with fines, beatings, or death. It was the idealistic Quakers who thought incarceration and labor might be a more compassionate and useful alternative. Whether this held in practice is debatable: Although many in Philadelphia’s infamous Walnut Street Jail, which opened in the late 1700s, spent their days making handicrafts like wicker chairs to sell, every single prisoner lived in solitary confinement.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the county jails that began cropping up in the U.S. during the first half of the 19th century made no attempt at reforming or employing inmates. Then in 1867, early muckrakers E.C. Wines and Theodore W. Dwight published a scathing exposé of American jails that called for prisons to become places that taught people how to become better citizens.</p>\r\n<p>Soon, all across the nation, those with an eye on rehabilitation and those with an eye on budgets found common ground in giving prisoners something useful and profitable to do. Leasing convicts to private businesses made a tidy fortune for both state and local governments, especially after slaves were emancipated. In 1878, 73% of Alabama’s entire state revenue came from prison labor. Reconstruction-era plantation owners, though, were hardly incentivized to care about their charges: When any of their starving workers died, they simply asked the state for new ones, at no cost to their bottom line.</p>\r\n<p>In the early 20th century, the tide of public opinion began to turn on prison labor. It wasn’t fair to allow such cheap workers in the market, the argument went, because it hurt competition and drove down wages for everybody. Since the late 1930s, prison labor in the United States has, for the most part, only been able to produce goods or provide services for the public sector.</p>\r\n<p>California’s fire camps began during World War II, when the state’s firefighters went off to fight and the inmates who had been tasked with building and maintaining public highways moved in to take their place. When the war ended, the state decided to keep them there. Nevada, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Arizona, and Utah all have since established fire camps of their own, but even the biggest of those programs is less than half the size of California’s. Now fire camps remain one of the last vestiges of a long American tradition of putting our criminals to work for hardly any money, under the auspices of rehabilitating them.</p>\r\n<p>“Prison labor has been most successful in areas where the risk of dying or being very seriously injured is pretty high,” said W. David Ball, an assistant professor in criminal justice at the Santa Clara University School of Law. After all, he says, convicted criminals have lost the right to manage their own lives, to a certain extent; when Congress passed the 13th Amendment in 1865, abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude, they made sure to include the following phrase: “except as a punishment for crime.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143140\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-5042-1414693632-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-5042-1414693632-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"997\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 949px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143140','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:1600px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143140','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"Fire camps remain one of the last vestiges of a long tradition of putting criminals to work for little money.\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3495754_4143140','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"Fire camps remain one of the last vestiges of a long tradition of putting criminals to work for little money.\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3495754_4143140','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"Fire camps remain one of the last vestiges of a long tradition of putting criminals to work for little money.\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-5042-1414693632-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Wes Schultz</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>“Atta baby!” Fire Captain Darus Ane shouted, extending his fist for a pound. “Nice work, baby! Beautiful!”</p>\r\n<p>The approaching inmate wheezed back a “Thanks, Cap!” before slowly lifting his hand from where it had been pushing down on his thigh with each step.</p>\r\n<p>A few yards downhill, Barr kept his eyes focused on the ground as he approached the ledge where Ane, a smiling Joe Biden look-alike with darker hair and a more genuine tan, was doling out words of encouragement.</p>\r\n<p>“Maintain! Last 50 to the top!” Ane called to him. Barr huffed and puffed, shaking his head as he passed, refusing to make eye contact with either me or the captain.</p>\r\n<p>Barr had been at camp for six weeks, and he was exhausted. He hadn’t seen a fire yet, but every day he woke up and threw his body into whatever task Ane and the foremen set before him: gathering brush in the forest, clearing debris by the side of the road, pushing through a timed hike like this one.</p>\r\n<p>If he didn’t get to the top in time, he would get written up; dawdle up the mountain more than once, and he could get sent back to jail. He and his 15-man fire crew — crew two — were charging uphill in a steady stream, swerving around rocks and scrub. Some could barely breathe. Others leaped like it was nothing, sweat forming a dark V on the back of their orange jumpsuits.</p>\r\n<p>Once he settled into the camp routine, when the initial relief of being away from the nightmare of county jail wore off, the severity of this work became apparent. The only possible relief would come from getting more physically fit: “You just have to train,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>Ane has been leading inmate crews for two and a half years, enough time for him to hone a tough but upbeat disposition in the hopes that he can reform his charges. “We gotta break them down physically to build them up mentally,” he told me. “We show them that it takes hard work to be successful, and hard work usually pays off.”</p>\r\n<p>The CDCR and state officials often frame the inmate firefighting program in a similar way, emphasizing the benefits of building discipline through physical labor and helping others.</p>\r\n<p>“Doing good things in life can change your whole world for you, because you will be remembered for that something good, instead of the negative,” former L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca <a href=\"http://www.dailynews.com/20121119/pitchess-detention-center-inmates-graduate-from-fire-training-camp\">told future fire camp inmates</a> at a county jail graduation ceremony in 2012.</p>\r\n<p>When Barr finally reached the summit, he was relieved to find that time had yet to run out. But just as he caught his breath it was time to pile back into the truck and head to another mountainside. There, crew two would throw on 40-pound packs, goggles, gloves, helmets, and boots, and spend three or four hours practicing what’s called “cutting line,” the primary contribution that inmates make to the surge of overlapping efforts involved in fighting and containing a wildfire.</p>\r\n<p>When cutting line, the goal is to carve a path of exposed mineral soil in the earth that will stop the flames, blocking their access to more fuel. The work is difficult, hot, and monotonous. The most senior guys on the crew walk in front with chainsaws, and all they do is saw, saw, saw. Other inmates chop the chaparral with a Pulaski, a tool that is half axe, half adze. As one of the newest guys on the crew, Barr was third from the back with a combination rake and hoe, called a McLeod, bending to scrape the dirt and push grasses out of the way until his back was sore and his body drenched in sweat.</p>\r\n<p>Paid firefighters cut line too, sometimes, but mostly they drive the bulldozers, they grip the hoses, they scribble strategy on clipboards, and they dump water and bright red retardant from air tankers and helicopters. Pretty much all inmates will do on a fire is head into steep terrain, where bulldozers can’t reach, and cut line.</p>\r\n<p>“Their value is that force of human power,” said Janet Upton, the deputy director of communications at Cal Fire.</p>\r\n<p>As he toiled in the sun for less $2 a day, Barr couldn’t help but point out what he saw as fire camp’s unacknowledged historical precedent: slavery. (Prisoner firefighters in California earn that base salary and an additional $1 an hour when they are on a fire.) “It’s not <i>right</i>,” he told me.</p>\r\n<p>Barr’s not the only inmate to make that comparison. A few years ago, when University of Toronto sociologist Philip Goodman was working on his dissertation at University of California – Irvine, he spoke to more than 45 prisoner firefighters. Ten used the word “slavery” to describe their experiences, but seven of those ten also used the word “rehabilitation.”</p>\r\n<p>Later that afternoon, back at camp, Barr was free to move about as he pleased: to play Ping-Pong or pinochle, to lift weights, to build a wooden clock with the circle saws in the hobby shop, to catch a movie on one of two big-screen TVs. He could take out as many books as he wanted from the library, rather than just one a week. He could joke around with guys of other races without fear of fights.</p>\r\n<p>One of the inmate chefs was outside plucking corn, peppers, and tomatoes from the camp garden to put in the salsa for that evening’s taco night. Two black Labradors roamed the camp off-leash, creating an oddly domestic feeling, even if they were there to sniff for drugs.</p>\r\n<p>“It’s better than where I was at. I’ll just leave it at that,” Barr said. “Here, at least, you can come outside.”</p>\r\n<p>He mostly hoped to make it through the next 11 months as quickly as possible. He also grew impatient with any talk of how this program could somehow fundamentally change him, as a person, for the better.</p>\r\n<p>Inmates are often insulted by the state’s claims to be teaching them how to work. Most come from poverty, where holding down two minimum wage jobs and putting in 70-hour weeks will get you nowhere fast. Many, as people of color, face profound socially and politically condoned opposition in ascending the socioeconomic ladder, regardless of how hard they work.</p>\r\n<p>Barr only has a high school education, and says selling crack seemed like the most lucrative option available to him. He regrets dropping out of junior college after less than a semester, and he snorts with laughter when he hears that part of the justification for sending him to fight fires is that he must learn how to work hard in order to abandon his criminal ways.</p>\r\n<p>“Of course I knew how to work hard before,” he said. “I was just working hard at something illegal.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143152\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1338-1414693695-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1338-1414693695-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1064\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1016px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143152','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:1600px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143152','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"Of course I knew how to work hard before, I was just working hard at something illegal.\"'>\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3495754_4143152','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"Of course I knew how to work hard before, I was just working hard at something illegal.\"'>\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3495754_4143152','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"Of course I knew how to work hard before, I was just working hard at something illegal.\"'>\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1338-1414693695-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Amanda Chicago Lewis for BuzzFeed</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Barr shifted in his seat as the Los Angeles County fire truck rumbled along the empty streets of Glendora. The day before, on Jan. 16, three guys in their early twenties had decided to go camping on federal land in Angeles National Forest. “Going to hunt mountain lions,” one posted on Facebook, before tagging his two friends. In the morning, the powerful Santa Ana winds blew a piece of paper from their illegal campfire into the brush, igniting the entire hillside. By the time Barr’s crew rolled in, over 3,600 residents had been evacuated and five homes destroyed due to what was being called the Colby Fire. The blaze had already consumed 1,700 acres since morning.</p>\r\n<p>Barr had been at fire camp for less than three months. The truck stopped, and the crew began to file off. “This was the test,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>January is not typically part of what’s called fire season, when conditions in the western United States are most likely to turn a flicked cigarette butt into a dangerous, expensive nightmare. The Colby Fire was one of over a thousand that came well before the end of spring in 2014, signaling this year would likely bring an unprecedented number of incidents, straining resources across the region.</p>\r\n<p>But the current drought — deemed “<a href=\"http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Home/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?CA\">exceptional</a>” in July by the federal government — is not an anomaly, a problem that will go away next year. It’s more like a warning shot, signaling a permanent shift in the moisture level of the soil, the brush and the timber. Although most firefighting personnel will hem and haw about why, exactly, the climate is changing, afraid to take what’s seen as a political stance on global warming, they all acknowledge that conditions are getting progressively worse. That means that in the coming years, Cal Fire will need to hire more firefighters and find money to pay for more frequent and intense blazes. Already, the coffers are in trouble.</p>\r\n<p>When Barr got to the Colby Fire, as soon as he started to work, adrenaline flooded his senses, bringing his attention to the task at hand. “That anxiety went away. It was just something regular. It kicked in, my training.”</p>\r\n<p>For 12 hours, from 4 p.m. to 4 a.m., he swept the ground with his McLeod, over and over, until the brown dirt turned to silt. They walked and walked, until they were inches from the flames. And a few times, as they strode at a rapid pace across inclines so precipitous they approached the vertical, he slipped and fell, but he always stood back up again, following the foreman, doing whatever was asked of him.</p>\r\n<p>“The foremen I have, they know what they’re doing. I know they wouldn’t put me in a dangerous situation,” he said. “Sometimes they have their days, probably had a bad day with the wife and kids, but other than that they treat us like, you know, like we’re one of them, basically, pretty much.”</p>\r\n<p>Finally, with the first glows of twilight, they headed back to Holton to get some rest before the next shift. When he got to camp, at dawn, Barr heard that some of the guys on another crew had screamed when they first got to the fire.</p>\r\n<p>“Like little girls,” he told me later. “Not crew two! We know what we’re doing.”</p>\r\n<p>On the afternoon of Jan. 17, when Barr returned to the fire for his second day, he could hardly feel the cuts and bruises from where he’d fallen the night before. Driving in, he saw the residents applauding them as they passed.</p>\r\n<p>His crew worked the fire for a week, and by the end he had developed a new respect for the firemen who took custody of him during the day, for their expertise and for the seriousness of their mission.</p>\r\n<p>Usually, inmate firefighters lack the cocksure gait that characterizes paid firefighters. But after his first fire, Barr began to walk with quiet purpose. He stopped muttering, started making eye contact with more people, and seemed to relax a bit.</p>\r\n<p>“You know, maybe it wasn’t bad, coming here,” Barr said a few weeks later. “You feel like you’re doing something, other than just sitting in jail. You feel like you’ve accomplished something.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143539\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20324-1414695088-33.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20324-1414695088-33.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1064\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1016px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143539','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:1600px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143539','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"This year, California has had over 5,300 wildfires, about 700 more than by this time in 2013.\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3495754_4143539','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"This year, California has had over 5,300 wildfires, about 700 more than by this time in 2013.\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3495754_4143539','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"This year, California has had over 5,300 wildfires, about 700 more than by this time in 2013.\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20324-1414695088-33.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Wes Schultz</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Under strict sentencing guidelines issued in the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s, nonviolent drug offenders like Barr have been clogging state and federal prisons for years, with no <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/ideas/publications/reports/pdf/lse-ideas-drugs-report-final-web.pdf\">discernible</a> decrease in the number of Americans using or selling drugs.

In 2011, after a protracted legal battle, the Supreme Court <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/us/24scotus.html?hp&amp;_r=0\">ordered</a> California to dramatically reduce the population of its prisons.</p>\r\n<p>To do so, instead of seeking significant sentencing reform for nonviolent drug offenders, Gov. Jerry Brown decided to shift responsibility for most low-level criminals from state prison to county jail, where conditions were not regulated under the court order.</p>\r\n<p>In some counties, this process — euphemistically called “realignment” — didn’t prove to be much of a problem, because they had space in their jails to spare, or made space to spare, but a <a href=\"http://www.law.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/child-page/183091/doc/slspublic/Petersilia%20VOICES%20no%20es%20Final%20022814.pdf\">third</a> of California’s state prison population comes from Los Angeles. Within two years, an additional 8,000 inmates, including Barr, were serving time in L.A. County jails.</p>\r\n<p>Fire camps had always been for state prisoners, not county inmates, because Cal Fire and the CDCR consider it a waste of money to train firefighters who have less than a year of time to serve. So with most low-level offenders no longer being housed at state prison, fire camps must negotiate separate contracts with individual counties, as they did with Los Angeles, in order to keep their barracks full. Barr is one of 528 L.A. County inmates who <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/17/local/la-me-0918-jail-problems-20130918\">began</a> filling five local fire camps at the end of last year. To inspire similar deals elsewhere, Brown’s 2014–2015 budget included major financial incentives for counties to send their low-level offenders to fire camp. And to encourage inmates like Barr to sign up, county inmates who go to fire camp serve only 35% of their sentences, even as their counterparts from state prison serve 50% or even 80%.</p>\r\n<p>But in the next few years, California <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-proposition47-20141012-story.html\">may see more</a> serious sentencing reform, which would help bring nonviolent drug offenders back to their families faster but would significantly damage the state’s firefighting capabilities at a time when every penny counts.</p>\r\n<p>Already, in 2012, voters passed a law that eliminated life sentences for most third-strike nonviolent offenders; next week, voters will likely pass a ballot measure called Proposition 47 that would go even further, downgrading drug possession and minor property crimes from felonies to misdemeanors. And at the end of September, Brown signed a bill that will reduce sentences for crack sales to the same level as cocaine sales, starting in 2015. Lynne Lyman, Drug Policy Alliance’s California state director, said she hopes this legislative win signals Brown will tackle more comprehensive sentencing reform for drug dealers if he is elected to a second term in November.</p>\r\n<p>After all, most people, other than law enforcement lobbying groups, now see the war on drugs as well intentioned but overzealous, sidelining perfectly good workers and making it difficult for them to re-enter the legitimate economy.</p>\r\n<p>So in the coming years, as fires increase and low-level prisoners go home earlier, California will need to make a choice: Pay full price for its firefighting workforce, or send more violent inmates out into the wilderness with powerful tools and very little security.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143395\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1426-1414694667-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1426-1414694667-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"721\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 673px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143395','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1426-1414694667-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Wes Schultz</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Barr had never used a chainsaw before, and it was lighter in his hands than he expected it to be. Over the course of the spring, as more and more inmates arrived from L.A. County jail, Barr had started to settle into the role of veteran. By the beginning of summer, Holton had transferred the bulk of its state prisoners to help fill spots at other fire camps around California.</p>\r\n<p>Only 10 now draw from the county jail population, and because lower-level offenders are no longer being housed at state prison, there are far fewer nonviolent inmates available to supply the other 32. Inmates are qualifying who never would have five years ago.</p>\r\n<p>So the foreman suggested Barr skip a few ranks and move right to the front, as the sawyer. “I got a lot of pull,” Barr explained. “Everyone knows me.” He revved the engine and contemplated the tangle of scrub oak blocking the path before him.</p>\r\n<p>The CDCR says it thoroughly evaluates every prisoner firefighter. But in 2011, before realignment even began, the <i>Redding Record-Searchlight</i>, a newspaper in Northern California, <a href=\"http://www.redding.com/news/inmates-man-fire-lines\">investigated</a> the fire camp population between 2005 and 2010 and found that, despite the CDCR’s supposedly strict screening, a fifth of all inmate firefighters had committed violent crimes, including carjacking, armed robbery, and manslaughter.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, there is no perfect litmus test to determine whether a convicted criminal will take the firefighting job seriously, or whether he will just do the minimum necessary to stay in camp. And nonviolent drug offenders aren’t even necessarily the most cooperative of the criminal population: <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/230601065_RISK_FACTORS_FOR_VIOLENT_BEHAVIOR_IN_PRISON_INMATES_A_Cross-Cultural_Contribution/links/09e41501da0e49503d000000\">Studies</a> show those who committed violent crimes are not more likely than nonviolent criminals to be violent once incarcerated.</p>\r\n<p>The challenge, Barr realized, as one branch, then another, fell to his feet, was in the angles. How were you supposed to know where to start the chop, and which direction to slash in? Surrounded by the stench of gasoline, Barr took another step forward, but before he knew what was happening, the chain got caught on something and slammed to a stop. Still running, the saw convulsively rebounded, bucking backward into his legs with unexpected torque.</p>\r\n<p>“Twice. I cut myself twice,” he said. He didn’t get hurt, but he did manage to slice through his chaps, which are made from several layers of Kevlar, a material often used in body armor because it is five times stronger than steel.</p>\r\n<p>“Twice!” he said again, as though he can’t even believe he was allowed to keep using the saw after cutting his chaps the first time. “So they’re like, you know, we’ll just make you a bucker.” The bucker walks a few feet behind the sawyer, grabbing the brush as it falls and tossing it away from the flames.</p>\r\n<p>“Good thing I had those chaps,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>Trusting an inexperienced criminal with a chainsaw hints at the peculiar, simultaneous empowerment and dehumanization that prisoner firefighters experience. And the use of such powerful machinery is one of the most controversial aspects of fire camp. But most people are less concerned about whether inmates will hurt themselves unintentionally and more worried about whether any criminal should be handed such potentially harmful tools of destruction.</p>\r\n<p>“We extend a lot of trust,” said Lt. Dave Foote, who commands Camp No. 11, in Acton. “The first time I saw an inmate with a chainsaw I thought, <i>Man, I made a wrong decision to come here</i>.”</p>\r\n<p>Even a polite inmate, a trustworthy inmate, might be cutting line in the wilderness one morning and then suddenly run off into the woods with his Pulaski axe. When firefighters take custody of the inmates during the day, there are no CDCR guards around to protect them. It’s just 15 to 17 inmates, alone in the middle of nowhere with chainsaws, axes, rakes, and two or three firefighters.</p>\r\n<p>Holton is one of only two camps in the state surrounded by a low fence; the other 40 are wide open. Holton is also less than a mile away from Angeles Shooting Range, where you can buy and repair guns, pick up some ammo, or take an accuracy class. Ron Cottriel, the 74-year-old manager there, says he never worries about the safety of his staff and his customers, despite being so close to a hundred prisoners.</p>\r\n<p>“Criminals are stupid, but they’re not that stupid,” he said. “You don’t come in here and expect to do harm when everybody is armed.”</p>\r\n<p>Then again, about <a href=\"http://www.mendocinobeacon.com/ci_23726595/state-prison-changes-continue-shifting-more-violent-felons\">half</a> the people who escaped from California prisons in 2011 and 2012 were prisoner firefighters. In 2005, <a href=\"http://www.redding.com/news/mother-murdered-officer-continues-pushed-fire-camp\">an inmate</a> walked away from a fire camp in Humboldt County; after nearly two years on the run, he shot and killed a San Francisco police officer.</p>\r\n<p>Back when he was a state senator, Congressman Doug LaMalfa attempted to pass legislation that would provide more detailed information to the firefighters who take custody during the day about the criminal history of the inmates they are overseeing. Brown vetoed the bill, calling it unnecessary.</p>\r\n<p>Now LaMalfa worries that we are too trusting, especially given the rising number of violent offenders at camps still supplied by state prison populations. After all, many of the projects that inmate firefighters do during the day, including landscaping at public parks, happen in and around towns.</p>\r\n<p>LaMalfa asked, “Do you really want your kids to walk anywhere near where that’s going on?”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143377\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-24366-1414694614-6.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-24366-1414694614-6.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"686\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 638px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:1600px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;The first time I saw an inmate with a chainsaw, I thought, 'Man, I made a wrong decision to come here.'&quot;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3495754_4143377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;The first time I saw an inmate with a chainsaw, I thought, 'Man, I made a wrong decision to come here.'&quot;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3495754_4143377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;The first time I saw an inmate with a chainsaw, I thought, 'Man, I made a wrong decision to come here.'&quot;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-24366-1414694614-6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Wes Schultz</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As the truck wended its way up Highway 32, Barr surveyed the mountains from the window, noting that there was manzanita up here too, just like near Holton. It was after sunrise on Tuesday, July 29, and he and his crew were a few hours outside of San Francisco, about to begin their second 24-hour shift in three days.</p>\r\n<p>One of their usual foremen had just been transferred, and a new guy who had never worked with inmates had come to take his place, but Barr wasn’t worried. He knew what he was doing. This fire, the Web Fire, was a minor incident, having burned fewer than 500 acres, and the one he had worked the day before, the Sand Fire, had been mostly extinguished by the time crew two showed up to do what’s called “mop-up.” He was only four months from freedom.</p>\r\n<p>When they parked, the temperature outside was only 70 degrees, but over the course of the day it was supposed to climb to 102. Throwing 40-pound packs on over their gear, they set off on a three-hour hike west into Web Hollow.</p>\r\n<p>Soon they reached their assigned area at the southern edge of the fire and got to work. Other than occasional shouts to “Bump up!” or “Bump down!” the mountain, the crew stayed quiet as they trekked sideways across the steep incline. It was too intense to talk.</p>\r\n<p>“It was treacherous, going up that mountain,” Barr told me. “We hiked it like three times, then we had to go back down and get water, and then we had to go back up there and sleep, and watch the mountain. The mountain was still on fire.”</p>\r\n<p>As the time ticked by, Barr’s body fell into the rhythm established by a year of grueling hikes and daily practice. The physical exertion, the mental stress, the imminent dangers — none of it really bothered him anymore. The only thing he never felt he could fully adjust to and forget about was the heat: the sticky, oppressive heat.</p>\r\n<p>On Wednesday morning, when Barr got off his shift, he was taken to the nearest fire camp an hour away. He ate some fruit and a breakfast burrito, took a shower, and prepared for his next 24-hour shift, which started the following morning. Several hundred miles from home, he was exhausted from sleeping on the rocky ground, he was dusted with soot from head to toe, and he was being escorted around camp by a tough CDCR guard who cut him no slack.</p>\r\n<p>But he was comfortable, grateful — happy, even, that he didn’t have to spend this past year surrounded by 131 other criminals in a loud, disgusting room, with <i>Iron Man</i> playing on repeat. Even as he insisted that the experience hasn’t changed him, as a person, he admitted that fire camp turned the time he had to serve from something soul-crushing into something productive. He does feel angry, though, when he thinks about how much cash he’ll be leaving with — maybe $1,200 at most for an entire year of work.</p>\r\n<p>“Pshh, this might be beyond slavery, whatever this is,” Barr told me, leaning forward to rest his arms onto the fire camp picnic table. He spoke with more confidence and ease than he had at any point in the past year, casually dismissing the previous day’s labor as easy in one breath while comparing the foremen to overseers in the next. “They don’t have a whip. That’s the difference,” he said. He laughed.</p>\r\n<p>The one thing he did know, as he contemplated what he’d do once he got out: He didn’t want to be a firefighter unless he had absolutely no other choice for employment. He’d never gotten over the physical discomfort of being around the hot flames. Every time was like the first time. It was counterintuitive to get this close to such heat, like jumping into an oven.</p>\r\n<p>It’s not easy for inmate firefighters to make the transition into professional firefighting. Wildland firefighter jobs are so competitive that 200 or 300 applications might come in for one opening, and Cal Fire is reluctant to promote the fact that they might hire well-trained felons over people with no criminal record, even for seasonal jobs. The Los Angeles County Fire Department won’t hire felons at all. Still, an estimated 3 to 5% of inmates do make the jump, often by working with the U.S. Forest Service. But Barr would really prefer to do something else.</p>\r\n<p>He explained he’d been practicing his algebra; reading up on stocks, bonds, and real estate; and savoring Machiavelli’s <i>The Prince</i>. He’d also been really into biographies lately because he likes reading about real people who achieve success. “I got plans to be a millionaire when I get out,” he said. “I just gotta figure out how.”</p>\r\n<p>At the end of September, California announced that it had run through the fiscal year’s entire wildfire budget in only three months and would need to start tapping into reserves meant for all natural disasters. The now never-ending fire season continues unabated, but any hopes that the federal government might offer additional help fizzled in August, when a bill that would increase funding for wildfire suppression died in the House of Representatives.</p>\r\n<p>Now the state must figure out how to do more with less.

The house we’ve been ogling is an otherwise unremarkable, well-tended beige two-story in a neighborhood of similar-looking dwellings in Fontana, a parched, charmless city 50 miles east of Los Angeles. It belongs to Juan’s cousin “Pablo” (his name has been changed to maintain the integrity of the investigation), whose identity Lozano has been using for years as he’s eluded detection, living in Mexico with Bianca. Lessan’s theory — or one of her many theories — is that Juan and/or Bianca could be in the house today. As she told me yesterday, “It’s my feeling these two have crossed the border and are back in the U.S.”</p>\r\n<p>At the moment, though, there’s no sign of anyone. Three cars are parked in front and Lessan has jotted down the corresponding license plate numbers, but none have moved in the three hours since we got here. We’re in the backseat, partially obscured by the tinted windows — “If we sit in front, it looks suspicious,” Lessan says — studying photos of Lozano and Bianca so we’ll be able to recognize them should we spot them.</p>\r\n<p>That’s all Lessan is hoping for today. She’s considered simply knocking on the door, but ultimately decided doing so could “burn” her — if Lozano isn’t there, Pablo might tip him off, and then Lozano would go even deeper underground.</p>\r\n<p>Lessan has been a licensed investigator for 21 years but hardly fits the traditional gumshoe profile. She’s a woman in a field dominated by men and has never worked in law enforcement or the military. From the minute I meet her, she’s warm and chatty. She’s slender, with long black hair, and today is wearing a black T-shirt, tight jeans, and sunglasses. Her words tend to tumble out in a stream-of-consciousness rush, and she’s prone to darting from subject to subject. Often these digressions slingshot the conversation back to Lessan’s favorite subjects: She hosts a weekly internet radio show devoted to discussing UFO sightings, the Illuminati, weather modification, and the like. On the ride out to Fontana, she casually, almost dismissively, explained how a small group of families, including the Rothschilds, the Clintons, the Bushes, and the Windsors, run the world, and that Dwight Eisenhower shook hands with aliens in 1954.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4088446\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/13/enhanced/webdr10/longform-28135-1414085047-20.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/13/enhanced/webdr10/longform-28135-1414085047-20.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"528\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 480px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4088446','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/13/enhanced/webdr10/longform-28135-1414085047-20.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Deana and Bianca </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Courtesy of Deana Hebert</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Lessan has been working on this case since August 2013, and she represents something of a Hail Mary in this nearly two-decade-long search. Bianca’s mother, Deana Hebert, whose Twitter handle is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MissingBianca\">@missingbianca</a>, has exhausted all of her resources and enlisted anyone and everyone she can — the police, the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the DA’s office, the Mexican Consulate, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, her congressman, multiple private investigators, several lawyers, family members, friends, volunteers — to look for her daughter. That they’ve all failed says as much about the slapdash, numbingly bureaucratic — if well-intentioned — system we have in this country for finding long-term missing children as it does about anything else. As Hebert put it, “Nobody wants to be responsible for anything in this case. Nobody wants to be in charge. It’s just me pushing and pushing.”</p>\r\n<p>If you were a parent whose daughter was abducted, how much would you pay for her safe return? Even the most well-meaning PIs must navigate the murky moral quandary of what is appropriate to charge a desperate parent to deliver the very thing in the universe they hold most dear. A friend of Hebert’s paid to hire Lessan — the third PI who’s been on the case — and right now this house in Fontana is her only viable lead. If we see either Lozano or Bianca today, the plan is to call Hebert so she can fly out from Texas to meet the fully grown woman she hasn’t seen since she was her 20-month-old toddler, and to contact Lessan’s friend who works as an investigator for Homeland Security, who could arrest Lozano.</p>\r\n<p>As morning turns to afternoon, Lessan’s getting antsy. She begins to consider going against her original instinct and knocking on that front door — there’s a yearning to do something, <i>anything</i>, to make the time spent feel like it wasn’t a total waste. Just as she’s on the verge of going to the door and potentially ruining six months of investigation, she catches a break: Girl Scouts. Walking down the street are two young girls and a mother, pulling a wagon behind them, going door to door selling cookies.</p>\r\n<p>We duck down in the van’s backseat as the Girl Scouts pass by. They ring Pablo’s doorbell, wait, then begin to walk away, when the door opens. A little girl, about 6 or 7 years old, stands in the doorway. Soon after, a woman who looks to be her mother comes out. Then a third woman emerges, and walks out onto the driveway to inspect the wagon. The third woman has dyed, red-tinged hair and looks to be in her late teens or early twenties.</p>\r\n<p>Lessan crawls toward the front of the minivan and snaps photos of the unfolding scene. From our vantage point, about 20 yards away, this third woman bears a resemblance to some of the photos of Bianca that have been found over the years on various social networking sites.</p>\r\n<p>“Could that be her?” I ask Lessan.</p>\r\n<p>“I don’t know,” she says. “Maybe.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw  \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4088460\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/13/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-buzz-wide-9740-1414085081-15.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/13/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-buzz-wide-9740-1414085081-15.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"424\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 376px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4088460','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:990px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4088460','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"If you were a parent whose daughter was abudcted, how much would you pay for her safe return?\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3486784_4088460','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"If you were a parent whose daughter was abudcted, how much would you pay for her safe return?\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3486784_4088460','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"If you were a parent whose daughter was abudcted, how much would you pay for her safe return?\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/13/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-buzz-wide-9740-1414085081-15.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Images of Bianca, including two digital simulations by the National Center For Missing And Exploited Children </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Courtesy of Deana Hebert and the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Every year, 200,000 children in the United States are abducted by a family member. Or maybe it’s 350,000. Or 2,000. In truth, no one really knows. The last year a <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/196465.pdf\">study</a> was done by the Justice Department was 1999. It claimed an estimated 1.3 million kids went missing that year and that 203,900 of those were taken by a family member. Those stats have been regurgitated for 15 years, and while there are significant questions as to how accurate they were back then, they’re certainly next to useless a decade and a half later. (A Justice Department spokesperson says there is a new report in the works, but it’s not expected to be published for at least a year.)</p>\r\n<p>The FBI tracks annual crime statistics and <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ncic/ncic-missing-person-and-unidentified-person-statistics-for-2013\">reported</a> that in 2013, 462,567 children went missing. Of those, 2,310 were abducted by a noncustodial parent. This is a number that, according to FBI statistics, has remained relatively static going back to at least 2007. It’s also a number rendered mostly worthless by the methodology behind it: When missing persons reports are filed by law enforcement, specifying the cause of the disappearance is optional.</p>\r\n<p>“Missing person entries are made primarily by the local law enforcement agency shortly after the missing person report is made,” Stephen Fischer Jr., chief of multimedia productions in the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services Division, explains in an email. “Having the correct name, date of birth and basic physical description is the primary concern. While the circumstances surrounding the incident will be collected as the investigation moves forward, the missing person entry will often not reflect this data.”</p>\r\n<p>This partially accounts for the enormous discrepancy between the FBI’s count and the Justice Department’s 1999 research. Still, nearly half those 2013 missing child reports <i>did</i> specify a cause, so following that logic, the number of children abducted by a family member each year falls somewhere between 4,620 and 203,900. Maybe. Robert L. Snow, a retired captain with the Indianapolis police who has written multiple <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001IXU3JG/?tag=buzz0f-20\">books</a> about kidnapping, thinks even the DOJ’s study undercounts parental abductions.</p>\r\n<p>“People don’t realize that a lot of abductions, particularly family abductions, are never reported,” he says. “People don’t want to air their dirty laundry. I have found research that says it could be as high as 350,000 parental abductions a year. … That’s why there’s so much apathy. No one realizes how big a problem this is.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4089771\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19446-1414092319-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19446-1414092319-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"625\" height=\"778\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 542px; top: 730px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4089771','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19446-1414092319-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Elizabeth Smart </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Getty Images</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4089821\" rel:buzz_num=\"10\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19850-1414092433-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19850-1414092433-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"625\" height=\"938\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 542px; top: 890px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:10\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4089821','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19850-1414092433-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Jaycee Dugard </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Carl Probyn / AP Photo</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This is pretty much how it goes when it comes to missing children in America. Despite huge amounts of sensationalistic coverage lavished on a few rare cases — Elizabeth Smart, Jaycee Dugard, etc. — for the most part, hardly anyone is paying attention. This is especially true of parental abductions, which everyone agrees — terrible stat-keeping notwithstanding — are far more common than the classic “stranger-danger” kidnapping most parents live in mortal fear of. (The 1999 DOJ study counted a grand total of 115 of these so-called “stereotypical kidnappings” that year.)</p>\r\n<p>According to Snow, most parental abductions tend to get resolved pretty quickly. In a percentage of these cases — again, who knows exactly what percentage — the parent is merely a few hours late returning with the child. In others, a call from the police or a lawyer threatening harsh consequences resolves the situation. Sometimes, the abductor has the intent to stay gone but no real plan, and authorities track him or her down in a matter of hours or days. It’s when days become weeks, months, and even years that whatever systems we have in place seem to break down completely.</p>\r\n<p>When the abductor leaves the country, the situation grows even more complicated. The Hague Abduction Convention, a 1980 treaty that has been agreed to by 92 countries, including the U.S. and Mexico, sets guidelines for the return of children kidnapped across international borders, but, in reality, even many countries that have signed it don’t comply with it.</p>\r\n<p>“When you go to a foreign country, an American warrant doesn’t mean much,” says Snow. “A lot of times you can’t get the local authorities to cooperate. A lot of countries are of the opinion that children are better off being raised in their country than in the United States. The U.S. can try to put pressure, but they don’t have much leverage. They’re not going to cut off aid or start a war over one child.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4089988\" rel:buzz_num=\"11\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-buzz-wide-11937-1414093711-19.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-buzz-wide-11937-1414093711-19.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"424\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 376px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:11\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4089988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-buzz-wide-11937-1414093711-19.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Deana Hebert</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Deana Hebert was worried the minute her then-husband walked out the door with their daughter. The couple were in midst of an ugly divorce, and Lozano had arrived on a Friday in April in 1995 to pick up Bianca for the weekend. Hebert was living with her parents in a small house in Baytown, a Houston suburb, and their custody arrangement meant Bianca spent most of the time with her. Lozano had her on Wednesdays and every other weekend.</p>\r\n<p>Hebert was born and raised in Baytown, and Lozano had moved there from Monterrey, Mexico, when he was a child. They were an odd couple: He was 6-foot-2 and 300 pounds; she was 5-foot-5, 100 pounds, and five years younger. These days, with all that’s happened, Hebert has trouble remembering what first drew them together. “I guess he made me laugh,” she says. They dated for about two years and married a month before Bianca was born, when Hebert was just 21. Lozano lost his job, leaving Hebert the family’s sole breadwinner. He grew moody and eventually abusive toward Hebert.</p>\r\n<p>“He was so scary,” she says. “He’s like Jekyll and Hyde. He can be so sweet and then so extreme opposite. If I’d stayed I would’ve ended up dead.” She and Bianca moved into her parents’ house, and she filed for divorce.</p>\r\n<p>Every time Lozano came to pick up Bianca, it was an ordeal. One Wednesday in January, Lozano got rough and dragged Hebert outside. She called the cops and filed charges for assault, but their custody arrangement remained unaltered.</p>\r\n<p>That Friday in April, Hebert sensed something was wrong. With Lozano scheduled to appear in court for the assault, their already troubled relationship was near its lowest point. Although Lozano and Bianca weren’t due to return until Sunday evening, Hebert was on edge the whole weekend. When he didn’t show up at 6 p.m., as agreed to, she was sure they weren’t coming back. Her mother tried to reassure her.</p>\r\n<p>“My mom goes, ‘You know how they run late. He’s playing games. He’s probably going to tell you he had to change her diaper.’” She sighs. “I said, ‘No. They’re gone.’ And I was right.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090133\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/18/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-26855-1414102979-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/18/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-26855-1414102979-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"510\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 462px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090133','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/18/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-26855-1414102979-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Chris Tuite for BuzzFeed</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s two days after the Fontana stakeout, and Lessan and I are driving, talking about the case — specifically why and how Bianca and Juan Lozano would be in the U.S. at the moment.

In a shockingly bright lime-green office, a producer shoots video of Lessan on his iPhone while asking questions like, “What’s your daily schedule like?” and “Do you carry a gun?”</p>\r\n<p>The reality of Lessan’s daily routine involves phone calls, database searches, and sitting for hours on end in parked cars more than it does high-speed chases or knocking down doors. Her rate normally ranges from around $3,000 up front for a local abduction case to a minimum of $10,000 for an international one, not including expenses. As a case progresses, costs escalate.

Lozano’s parents. Her lawyer. The police. The FBI. As the weeks turned to months and eventually years, a dizzying number of government agencies got involved: Besides the Baytown Police Department and the FBI, an incomplete list includes the U.S. Marshals Service, the Harris County district attorney’s office, the State Department, the Mexican Consulate, and the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\r\n<p>“What I found is that the agencies don’t communicate with each other,” she says. “So any information I got, I’d make sure I sent it to the DA’s detective, Baytown police, FBI, the congressman’s office. I was the hub.”</p>\r\n<p>Managing the investigation into her daughter’s abduction while simultaneously trying to mourn the loss was not ideal, but during the first year or two she was grateful in some ways to have something to do. For a while, she clung to the belief that the man she once married would eventually come to his senses and bring Bianca back. “I still remember feeling like, <i>Oh, this is going to blow over</i>,” she says.</p>\r\n<p>It didn’t. Her divorce was finalized. After a year or so, the trail was cold. Soon, Hebert was out of money, out of ideas, and trying to figure out how to go on living when her main reason for doing so had been replaced by a giant, unfathomable void.</p>\r\n<p>“I was so busy at first, involved in everything, and then all of a sudden everything just stopped,” she says. “I didn’t know how to grieve. I just put everything in a compartment in my head and kind of left it there.” But she eventually realized if she didn’t want to live out her days as the empty shell she felt like, she had to start filling them with something. “Being in my twenties and being single, it was hard when you’d meet somebody and they’d say, ‘Oh, do you have kids?’ Sometimes it was easier just to say no, because when you tell some people that your child was kidnapped, they say, ‘Oh, OK,’ and just go on with the conversation. Then some people freak out and start crying like you’ve dropped a bomb on them.”</p>\r\n<p>Eventually she met someone else and got remarried in 1999.

She scoured the internet for any signs of her or Lozano. The month after Bianca disappeared, she had <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/tx-supreme-court/1338009.html\">sued</a> Lozano’s parents, who she believes have been helping him, and at one point won a $2.2 million judgment, though after several years and various appeals, a retrial was ordered and Hebert, her parents, and her attorney made the decision not to go forward. Years later, she tried to repair relations with his family in the hopes that they could facilitate Bianca’s return. Nothing worked.</p>\r\n<p>“There’s two different parts of me,” she says. “There’s one part that’s Bianca’s mom, searching and doing all these things, and there’s the other part that goes on with life and tries to do normal things. But nothing has ever replaced her.”</p>\r\n<p>In 2009, 14 years after Bianca’s initial disappearance, Hebert turned to her congressman, Pete Olson, for help, and met Kimberli Reed, who was Olson’s director of casework at the time. They forged an immediate bond: In 2002, Reed had had her own children literally snatched from her in a parking lot by her estranged husband. It took five months for her to track them down, and a year before she was granted full custody.</p>\r\n<p>“I know what I went through for five measly months,” says Reed. “I have no idea what it would be like to go through this for all this time. It’s amazing she hasn’t gone insane.”</p>\r\n<p>By the time Reed met Hebert, the investigation into Bianca’s whereabouts had deteriorated to the point where it could hardly even be called an investigation.</p>\r\n<p>“It was dead,” says Reed. “There were probably seven or eight years in there that no one was doing anything, except for Deana. Baytown PD had totally written it off. Harris County district attorney’s office had washed its hands of it. The State Department had closed the case. There wasn’t a notice or a flag put into Homeland Security for Juan. Mexico knew nothing about the case.”</p>\r\n<p>Reed took up the cause, and “for the next four years,” she says, “I literally spent every day searching for Bianca.” She tried to use her clout at the congressman’s office to knock heads together at various government agencies. In 2009, she helped convene a roundtable meeting that included representatives of the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Harris County DA, the Mexican Consulate, and the Mexican attorney general’s office, with a representative from the State Department conferenced in on the phone. She asked if anyone could contact and question Lozano’s family.</p>\r\n<p>“All of them looked at Deana and me and said, ‘There’s nothing we can do,’” Reed recalls. The Mexican representatives told her they did not consider Lozano a criminal because Bianca is his daughter. The FBI said that its hands were tied because it had no jurisdiction in Mexico. The State Department staffer said it couldn’t do anything and made clear that once Bianca turned 18 and was no longer a missing child but a missing adult, the department wouldn’t work the case at all.</p>\r\n<p>“Everyone kept saying, ‘We can’t do anything until we locate her, and we can’t locate her so we can’t do anything,’” says Reed. Even if it did manage to find Lozano, the Harris County DA wasn’t even sure if it would extradite him.</p>\r\n<p>A warrant for Lozano’s arrest was eventually issued in the U.S., and a few years ago Interpol, which tracks fugitives across international borders, put him on a watch list. At one point, Hebert discovered that if she could pinpoint Lozano in Mexico, U.S. marshals were authorized to bring him back to the U.S. and arrest him. But the Marshals Office told her it wouldn’t, “because the original warrant was filed by the FBI, and the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Office [wouldn’t] work together,” Hebert tells me.</p>\r\n<p>“There were certain detectives in certain agencies that have been very dedicated,” she continues. “Other times, I try to get in touch about something and don’t hear from them for months. I know they’re busy, they’re on other things, this is an old case, but it’s just frustrating. It would be nice to have one central agency that only worked on missing children’s cases.”</p>\r\n<p>According to Snow, this is a key failing of the current system. “No one really takes responsibility for abducted children,” he says. “It’s a criminal offense, but there’s no specific agency meant to take these cases.” Even within the agencies that end up saddled with kidnapping cases, there’s a distinct lack of expertise. “In Indianapolis, we’ve got a huge police department, 1,500 officers,” says Snow. “We’ve got no abduction unit. Very few police departments have a unit specifically trained for this. It just goes to a general officer and he handles this like he handles other cases. So that officer has very little experience and training in it.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090445\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-21908-1414096119-10.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-21908-1414096119-10.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"658\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 610px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:16\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090445','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-21908-1414096119-10.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Chris Tuite for BuzzFeed</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security’s San Diego office is in a modern downtown office building a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean. Lessan is there to meet with her friend, Maurice Wrighten, who works as an investigator in the cybercrimes division. Lessan has known him for 15 years, and he seems willing to help but isn’t certain exactly how. From a manila folder, she pulls out a copy of a Mexican ID card: It’s Lozano’s picture but Pablo’s name and information, and Lozano used it to get a job in Mexico a few years ago. She then pulls out two birth certificates. One is a copy of Bianca’s legitimate American one; the other is a Mexican one that Lessan has uncovered, with an alias, “Fabiola Suarez Elizondo,” a birth date of more than a year earlier, and Pablo listed as the father.</p>\r\n<p>Wrighten studies the documents. One of the many complications of Bianca’s case is that although she was abducted as a child, she’s now 21. Technically, she’s an adult, making her own decisions. Since Bianca’s broken no laws herself, Wrighten can’t really investigate her.</p>\r\n<p>Lozano is a different story. Wrighten says the identity fraud is a way in, but “if he’s using a fake Mexican ID in Mexico, that has nothing to do with us. He’s not breaking any U.S. laws.” As long as he’s in Mexico, he’s beyond the reach of Homeland Security. He looks again through the manila file.</p>\r\n<p>“There might be a way I can do this, but I can’t tell you how right now,” he says. He promises to be back in touch. As Wrighten walks us to the door, Lessan thanks him and asks, almost pleadingly, “What do you think?”</p>\r\n<p>He nods. “There’s hope.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090484\" rel:buzz_num=\"17\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/17/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-20144-1414099062-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/17/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-20144-1414099062-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"510\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 462px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:17\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090484','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/17/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-20144-1414099062-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is the one entity that seems best positioned to step into the breach and bring order to all this chaos. Although the NCMEC is ostensibly an independent nonprofit, it gets considerable funding — <a href=\"http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34050.pdf\">$67 million in 2014</a> — from the federal government. Opinions on its effectiveness vary wildly. Reed says that the NCMEC is “completely inept.”</p>\r\n<p>“All they do is run a website, create fliers, and that’s it,” she says. And when newer photos of Bianca were found, getting it to update the fliers proved an ordeal. “The entire time I was with the congressman’s office, they essentially did nothing. ‘She’s on our website,’ ‘We have flyers out there,’ was all they’d do.” (A recent check of Bianca Lozano’s profile on the NCMEC <a href=\"http://www.missingkids.com/poster/NCMC/803912/1\">website</a> had an updated photo, but in one spot it misstates the date of her disappearance by 17 years.)</p>\r\n<p>On its website, the NCMEC claims to have helped recover over 199,000 children since its founding in 1984, with a recovery rate of 97%. When I spoke to Bob Lowery, vice president of the NCMEC’s Missing Children Division, he said the actual number now is closer to 98% or 99%. Some question these figures, noting that the NCMEC takes credit for “helping” to recover children in cases it had virtually no involvement in. In some cases, these children were never actually missing (merely reported so by a panicky parent), or were returned by a noncustodial parent within hours of being reported. Critics of the NCMEC say it overstates its usefulness to justify its federal funding, and in doing so distorts public perception about the nature of the problem.</p>\r\n<p>When I spoke to Marc Klaas, who founded the KlaasKids Foundation to aid in the recovery of missing children after his own daughter, Polly, was abducted and murdered back in 1993, he launched, unprompted, into a bitter condemnation of the NCMEC.</p>\r\n<p>“I’ve got a real beef with these characters,” he says. “They don’t really go in the field. They don’t really get involved in any except the high-profile cases. They’ve done more to harm the missing child — I don’t want to call it an industry, but missing child nonprofit organizations — than any other single entity out there. They work very hard to make sure every dollar involved in missing children goes directly to them. They don’t share any resources whatsoever, and I can tell you from personal experience they’ll go out of their way to undermine anybody that might threaten their position. … They’re just guys in the middle vacuuming up money. I loathe the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and think missing kids would be better served if they didn’t exist.”</p>\r\n<p>Lowery, not surprisingly, takes issue with these portrayals.</p>\r\n<p>“Those are misinformed impressions about the National Center’s work,” he says. “The work here in the Missing Children’s Division is much more comprehensive than simply creating a poster and distributing it. … All our teams are former law enforcement or social services with a great deal of experience in finding children. We do extensive case analysis work, we work social media, we have law enforcement partners in our building working side by side with us, so when leads come in that need law enforcement activity right away, we’re getting it.”</p>\r\n<p>There are dozens of other nonprofits that focus on recovering missing children, though sorting the merely well-intentioned from those actually well-equipped to help can be tricky (never mind the ones devoted mostly to collecting donations, including the Committee for Missing Children, Operation Lookout National Center for Missing Youth, and Find the Children, three of the 50 worst charities in the country, according to an <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/americas-worst-charities/\">investigation</a> by the <i>Tampa Bay Times</i> and the Center for Investigative Reporting).</p>\r\n<p>A few years after Bianca went missing, Hebert met with Mark Miller, founder of the American Association for Lost Children, a nonprofit that, according to its website, conducts “hands-on investigations, while traveling in and outside the country performing surveillance and undercover work searching for and rescuing missing children.” Hebert says Miller convinced another mother whose own children were missing to date one of Lozano’s cousins in order to try to get information on Lozano’s whereabouts.</p>\r\n<p>“After a few dates, in the throes of whatever they were in the middle of, she confessed that she was working for Miller and the whole thing blew up in her face,” Hebert says. Later, when Hebert was organizing a concert to raise money for her continuing search efforts, she got into a dispute with Miller over what percentage of the proceeds would go to his organization. In the end, she says, “I don’t really know a lot of what he did or didn’t do working on Bianca’s case.”</p>\r\n<p>(When contacted, Miller says that he encourages all parents to “be on our team,” and help out with cases other than their own. He contends that although the other mother blew their cover, she did help procure useful information. He also insists that the money he wanted Hebert to donate to his charity was going to directly fund her case. According to Miller, the foundation spent thousands of dollars on Hebert’s case and she “never donated one penny to the charity.”)</p>\r\n<p>With both government agencies and nonprofits often creating more confusion than they alleviate, many parents turn to private investigators. Unfortunately, the world of PIs is possibly even more opaque. Licensing varies from state to state, and in most cases doesn’t seem particularly rigorous. According to Lessan, the main advantage a licensed investigator has over an unlicensed one is a badge. “To be honest,” she says, “people don’t know that there’s no difference.”</p>\r\n<p>Given this landscape, it’s not surprising that nightmare stories of PIs ripping off parents are legion. In 2009, an investigator in Arizona was <a href=\"http://tucson.com/news/local/crime/counts-of-wire-fraud-for-local-man/article_a92d794a-f880-5174-be33-c9ce81251484.html\">indicted</a> on five counts of wire fraud relating to charges that he created a fake abducted child recovery company, Delta International, which collected huge fees from parents and delivered virtually nothing in return. Gus Zamora, an ex–Army Ranger whose renown for recovering children abducted internationally has garnered him features on <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21134540/vp/39080442#39080442\"><i>Dateline</i></a> and in <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/11/the-snatchback/307704/\"><i>The Atlantic</i></a>, has also been accused, <a href=\"http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/zamora-and-associates-fraud-conman-ripoff-c610013.html\">multiple</a> <a href=\"http://www.zamoraandassociates.ca/about.html\">times</a>, of defrauding parents.</p>\r\n<p>Hebert first hired a PI based in Houston a few months after Lozano absconded with Bianca. She says she traveled to Mexico four times with this investigator, who insisted he’d seen Bianca while doing surveillance down there for her.</p>\r\n<p>“We were going to go down there again, rent a plane, hire these guys with guns, kidnap my daughter, and bring her back,” says Hebert. But she wasn’t too confident in this plan, and was running out of money. Around the same time, she met Don Feeney, an ex–Delta Force commando working in private security consulting, who’d helped retrieve kidnapped children before. She decided to spend the last $10,000 she could get her hands on — money that her mother had to borrow from Hebert’s grandparents — to pay Feeney to follow up on the earlier investigator’s information. “They came back and said, ‘This is not your daughter and not your ex-husband. You would’ve been in a world of trouble if you’d kidnapped that girl and tried to come back here with her.’ It was crazy.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090605\" rel:buzz_num=\"21\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-18059-1414097587-29.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-18059-1414097587-29.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"367\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 319px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:21\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090605','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-18059-1414097587-29.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 2013, Hebert finally caught a break. A man got in touch via a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Nina-Suarez-seguimos-buscandote/214673721899196\">Facebook page</a> she’d set up, telling her that his sister Norma had had a baby with Lozano, whom she knew as “Pablo.” She had lived with him and Bianca — whom she knew as “Nina” — in Monterrey, Mexico, but Lozano was abusive, and now Norma was on the run from him. She’d begun to grow suspicious about his past, and after finding the Facebook page Hebert had set up, was concerned Lozano would kidnap her own son, so she took the boy and went into hiding.</p>\r\n<p>In a series of conversations Hebert and a Spanish-speaking friend had with Norma’s brother and father, Hebert began hearing the first details of her daughter’s life, most of them heartbreaking: Bianca had been told that her mother died during childbirth. She lived in fear of her father. She had no idea she was a U.S. citizen and didn’t even know her real name. She was diabetic, played the guitar, and although she had no formal education, took classes at a music school in Monterrey.</p>\r\n<p>“I desperately wanted to talk to Norma because she’s the only person I know that knows my daughter,” says Hebert. But Norma’s family kept her hidden, fearing for her and her son’s safety. Still, working off these leads, Hebert and Reed found a Russian pen pal of Bianca’s named Natalia, who told them they thought Lozano monitored all of Bianca’s online communication. Around this time, Hebert was also directed to some short YouTube clips of her daughter playing guitar.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090506\" rel:buzz_num=\"18\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr07/longform-6913-1414096778-11.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr07/longform-6913-1414096778-11.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"301\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 253px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:18\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090506','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr07/longform-6913-1414096778-11.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>“That was when I saw her for the first time in 18 years,” says Hebert. “I knew it was her.

Hebert has mostly dismissed the possibility that the red-haired woman we saw here days earlier could be her daughter but believes if we talk to Pablo, he might have some clues as to where Lozano and Bianca might be. Lessan wanted to wait to see what Wrighten came up with, and still worries that if she confronts Pablo, he’ll immediately call Lozano with the information. But as Hebert put it during a three-way call with Reed and Lessan the night before, “What’s he going to tell Juan? That I have an investigator? I think he knows that from what we’ve put on Facebook. We’re not going to be any worse off than we are now.”</p>\r\n<p>It’s late afternoon and the plan is to wait until Pablo gets home from work, then knock on the door. If he doesn’t slam it in our faces, Hebert has given us a letter for him that explains her plight. So we wait. And wait. One of the women we saw the other day — short, ponytail, late thirties or early forties — arrives home and goes inside. We wait some more. It’s now almost 7 p.m. and getting dark outside. Where is Pablo? We discuss the possibilities. Maybe he works from home. Maybe he’s unemployed. Maybe he’s out with friends. Time isn’t on our side. Waiting any longer as it gets darker is going to make an already tense doorway confrontation all the more unsettling. Lessan decides it’s time.</p>\r\n<p>She knocks on the door and a female voice from the other side asks, “Who is it?”</p>\r\n<p>“This is Monique. I just wanted to show you something.”</p>\r\n<p>The door opens to reveal the woman with the ponytail, presumably Pablo’s wife. Lessan flashes her private investigator license and explains that we are looking for Pablo, but refuses to explain why. Pablo’s not home, we’re told, but will be soon. The woman asks if Lessan would like to leave a message for him.</p>\r\n<p>“I can just wait,” says Lessan. “I prefer to talk to him, actually.”</p>\r\n<p>“OK,” the woman says warily. “I’ll let him know.” Then she closes the door.</p>\r\n<p>So the wait continues, now on the sidewalk in front of the house. We debate whether Pablo will ever come home tonight, what he’ll say if he does, and how long we can stand around out here on a Wednesday night before someone calls the cops.</p>\r\n<p>By the time Pablo pulls up it’s past 8 p.m. We walk toward him in his driveway, just as his wife comes out the front door again. Lessan introduces herself and asks if we can come inside to show him some information. He looks at us the way you would look at any two strangers who just accosted you in your driveway on a dark Wednesday night insisting, somewhat frantically, that they wanted to come into your house. Lessan presses the case, asking again if we can just come inside for a minute. Pablo and his wife don’t look wary anymore, they look downright scared.</p>\r\n<p>Lessan changes tack and tries to hand Pablo the letter Hebert wrote for him. He recoils from the envelope as if it was radioactive, and mumbles something about not knowing what legal implications might come with accepting the letter. I offer to read it aloud. Nobody objects, so I do.</p>\r\n<p>The letter explains Hebert’s entire agonizing, Kafkaesque, two-decade-long ordeal — the kidnapping, the identity theft, the fruitless searching, the pain of not knowing. It seems to settle the moment. Pablo and his wife look stunned. Lessan asks if she can show them some documentation right here in the driveway. We move under an outdoor floodlight and she lays out the same documents she showed Wrighten on the hood of the family’s car, building the case, piece by piece.</p>\r\n<p>When she’s done, Pablo shakes his head. He hasn’t seen his cousin Juan Lozano since they were kids. He doesn’t know anything about the kidnapping. He didn’t even know he had been married or had kids. He saw Lozano’s parents last year when they came to California for a funeral, but other than that, he’s had hardly any contact with that branch of the family in decades. He expresses a willingness to help find out where his cousin is, but quite sensibly, seems most concerned with the fact that Lozano — an international fugitive — is running around using his identity.</p>\r\n<p>It’s possible that Pablo is lying about all this, and that Lozano and Bianca are hiding in the house right behind us, but I don’t think so. Standing here in the driveway, he and his wife don’t look like accessories to an international abduction. They look like shell-shocked parents. Lessan thanks them for their time, and Pablo promises to get in touch once he’s talked to some of his family.</p>\r\n<p>Back in the minivan, Lessan phones Hebert and Reed. As she drives and talks, she’s emotional, buzzing with adrenaline. She offers a blow-by-blow account of the evening, pausing every few seconds to take a deep breath, and concludes that it went very well.</p>\r\n<p>“He wants to help,” she says, exhaling deeply. “He was very concerned. He wouldn’t give us his phone number but said, ‘Don’t worry, I’m going to make some calls and get in touch with you.’ I’m glad at his response. Hopefully something will come out of it.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090528\" rel:buzz_num=\"19\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/17/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-buzz-wide-6124-1414098123-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/17/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-buzz-wide-6124-1414098123-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"367\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 319px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:19\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090528','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/17/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-buzz-wide-6124-1414098123-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>For a long time, nothing does. For months, there’s no word from Pablo, nothing of note from Wrighten, and after the momentary excitement in Fontana, the investigation has settled back into low gear. There’s no more money for Lessan. All the leads from Norma have been chased down and come to nothing.</p>\r\n<p>In late March, I call Hebert and ask how she’s feeling about the state of the search. “It’s the same old thing — another dead end,” she says. “We spent all this money, and yeah, we made contact with the cousin, but he hasn’t done anything. I don’t know if he’s ever interested in helping.” She sighs. “Everything I do turns up nothing, so I don’t know what to think anymore. I don’t let myself get too excited about anything because honestly I can’t handle it anymore. I’m at the point where — I’m not done, but it’s getting to be too much.”</p>\r\n<p>Then in May, Pablo calls. He’s apologetic for not getting in touch sooner, but as Hebert puts it, “He was shocked and felt kind of violated. … He has had to process it on his own.” He suggests the outlines of a possible deal: If Hebert drops the charges against her ex-husband, maybe Lozano would allow Bianca to return to the U.S. and be reunited with her. Hebert immediately agrees. Pablo says they’d need the agreement in writing.</p>\r\n<p>Hebert emails the Harris County assistant district attorney, who makes clear this isn’t something they normally do — “She said, ‘We don’t negotiate with felons. This is not justice’” — but they’ll make an exception. Hebert sends the letter to Pablo, and for the first time in a very long time, she allows herself a measure of optimism.</p>\r\n<p>“Who knows what this is going to turn into, but I have a little hope this is going to work out,” she says. I tell her that it seems like a smart move for Lozano. Whatever his situation in Mexico might be right now, having to keep hawkish watch over a 21-year-old woman is hardly the same as doing so with a young girl. That can’t be much of a life for him. Perhaps he wants out.</p>\r\n<p>“That’s what I think,” she says. “Everybody I’ve talked to says, ‘He’s stupid if he doesn’t do this. He’ll be free.’” She’s thought a lot about what a reunion with her daughter might actually be like. They haven’t seen each other in nearly 20 years. Her daughter has no memory of her. They’d effectively be strangers. Would Bianca move in? Would she call her “Mom”? Who knows, but if nothing else, she’d know the truth.</p>\r\n<p>“Her friends [at music school] told me her dream was to be an American citizen and play music here,” she says. “Everything in her life is a lie: her name, her birthday, her dad’s name, where he came from. … It’s got to be a terrible life. She could have so much if she came here.”</p>\r\n<p>For the next few days, there are droplets of news. An uncle of Lozano’s believes the deal is a good idea and will try to talk to his sister — Lozano’s mom — about it. Other family members apparently agree.</p>\r\n<p>Then for a month, there’s little word at all. Finally, Pablo calls Lozano’s mom himself but can’t reach her. He sends a letter to Lozano’s sister that goes unanswered. When I speak to Hebert in mid-June, she’s frustrated.</p>\r\n<p>“I don’t know why they’re dragging their feet,” she says. “Maybe they don’t want to tell Bianca. I’m not sure how you tell someone their entire life is a lie.”</p>\r\n<p>Two more months pass and I call to get an update. Hebert sighs deeply. “I haven’t heard from them at all,” she says. “I think it’s going to fizzle out.”</p>\r\n<p>She sounds as low as I’ve heard her. After all this — not just these recent events, but years of struggle with cops, private detectives, federal agencies, a congressman, Mexican authorities, nonprofits, volunteers, friends, family, acquaintances, and yes, journalists, with those who were helpful and those who weren’t, dealing with a system seemingly incapable of marshaling its best resources to grapple with a problem that should be solvable — Hebert finds herself no closer to getting her daughter back than she was in 1995. She hasn’t exactly lost hope, but having been through so much with so many people, at the moment, she’s feeling very much alone.</p>\r\n<p>“The thing is about stories like this, people will see it, read it, maybe post it on Facebook, but then they move on with their lives,” she says. “And I’m sitting back here waiting for my daughter to show up.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4082943\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Want to read more stories like this?

He didn’t want to show his face on camera, and I didn’t care whether it was because he was famous, married, or ugly. The internet was so slow that the sound stalled, so the dirty talk had to be typed.</p>\r\n<p>It was a terse, space-economizing raunch, pounded out letter by letter with his left index finger, since his dominant hand was busy. I WANT TO VERB YOUR NOUN. But the artlessness was a relief. The more work it took to type, the less likely he’d waste time asking about my hospital bed and IV rack. If I didn’t mind him being headless and talking like a filthy grown-up “see spot run,” couldn’t he handle a naked stranger in a tuberculosis sanatorium?</p>\r\n<p>Nor did he mention the armband, which hid the nozzle nurses screwed to dripping sacks of drugs during infusions. Three times a week, amikacin seeped down the skinny 2-foot-long tube inside and up my arm, leading behind my collarbone to splash into a big fat artery over my heart.</p>\r\n<p><i>Just please don’t fucking ask,</i> I thought. It was exhausting to explain. Screw this guy. Wouldn’t it be weirder if he <i>had</i> inferred a medical emergency, but resolved not to let it ruin his hard-on? Do virtual strangers without heads even have cognition? What the hell was wrong with this guy’s face, anyway?</p>\r\n<p><i>Who cares?</i> I had been in that room in Denver for almost a month. I was days away from lung surgery to remove my upper right lobe, where the bulk of the disease was headquartered. This was the last goddamned time I’d ever get to show my tits to a stranger without any scars. And it was the skinniest I’d ever been.</p>\r\n<p>I had contracted extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR-TB (a severe version of multidrug-resistant, or MDR tuberculosis), while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Ukraine. The National Jewish Health Center is no longer a sanatorium, but it is still one of the country’s top TB research facilities, staffed by worldwide mycobacteria experts and equipped with properly ventilated rooms for the infrequent consumptives who turn up there.</p>\r\n<p>When I was admitted to the hospital, the state of Colorado dispatched a guy to my hospital room to read me my legal quarantine order. I’d be in isolation for however long I was contagious.</p>\r\n<p>During my stay, I started a two-year course of harsh antibiotics, including an IV drip. I had two surgeries, which flanked a blood transfusion and peskily recollapsing lung. I lost 12 pounds and half my blood, which have been replaced, and the upper lobe of my right lung, which hasn’t. I wish I could be more inspiring. But I didn’t use that time to write a novel, learn yoga, or even plow through a beach read. Falling into a trance and getting off strangers was all I felt capable of.</p>\r\n<p>Objectifying? Sure. So is being sick.</p>\r\n<p>Such isolation — both physical and emotional — takes a serious toll on TB patients. From the 18th century glory days up to the modern rise of MDR, tuberculosis went from being a relatively universal human experience to being a profoundly lonely one. Isolation and stigma make long treatments even harder to endure and inhibit public consciousness that could lead to more meaningful progress. But we may be approaching a new historical moment: Social media makes it easier than ever for patients to find and support one another. These connections can improve patient morale and treatment outcomes and ultimately raise the profile of MDR-TB in global health policy.</p>\r\n<p>Because I was never as alone as I thought: Five thousand miles away in Siberia, a woman my age named Ksenia Shchenina was also suffering. So are patients in dozens of other countries, and more and more of them are beginning to use the internet to combat the solitude that has long not only defined the disease and its treatment, but kept it from being eradicated for good.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4041988\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-592-1413502678-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-592-1413502678-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"371\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 323px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4041988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:990px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4041988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;This was the last goddamned time I'd ever get to show my tits to a stranger without any scars.&quot;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3480022_4041988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;This was the last goddamned time I'd ever get to show my tits to a stranger without any scars.&quot;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3480022_4041988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;This was the last goddamned time I'd ever get to show my tits to a stranger without any scars.&quot;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-592-1413502678-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people don’t spend much time thinking about tuberculosis. If pressed, they might make a few basic generalizations. It was a very serious disease in the olden days. It killed your great-great-grandfather, all of the Brontës, and Nicole Kidman’s character in <i>Moulin Rouge</i>. But then it was cured. It doesn’t exist anymore. So we’ll all just have to get Ewan McGregor’s attention some other way and die of something else.</p>\r\n<p>Tuberculosis has been on the scene since ancient times, but it only reached menace status in filthy, urbanizing mid-17th century Europe. It went on to dominate the continent’s “cause of death” list for over two centuries. This makes sense, if you know how germs work. Poverty and bad sanitation — e.g., the Industrial Revolution’s toxic work conditions and shantytowns — made toppling immune systems a cinch. Before germ theory caught on, some people even saw TB as a sort of moral retribution for the sins of modernity.</p>\r\n<p>Even the disease’s classic name — <i>consumption —</i> implied a physical and spiritual connection. It consumed you; it devoured you from within. Before the scientific consensus on how an infectious disease was transmitted, many people assumed a person could be predisposed to consumption. (They caught on to genetics before they unraveled epidemiology.) An entire family of consumptives probably meant they were ill because they had all inherited the proper preconditions for the illness — not because they lived together and coughed fatal microbes into one another’s food. Similarly, researchers couldn’t help but notice that consumption disproportionately seized writers and artists, whose lifestyle was practically synonymous with urban poverty. But when it was still assumed that the disease grew from within, many scientists searched for a <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=4gIAAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA32&amp;dq=artistic+temperament,+consumption,+cause&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bVRuU_v1HaqhsQTso4GoBg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=genius&amp;f=false\">link between</a> consumption and genius. This is the kind of factoid that makes you feel smug when modern doctors are really, really surprised that you got this.</p>\r\n<p>The jig was up in 1882. A German bacteriologist named Robert Koch zeroed in on the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, the bacterial cause of consumption. It spread from person to person <i>by air.</i></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042155\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-475-1413501327-18.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-475-1413501327-18.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"421\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 373px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042155','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-475-1413501327-18.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Robert Koch </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Ann Ronan Pictures / Getty Images</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Koch’s early attempts to develop a vaccine failed, but his efforts did yield a valuable diagnostic tool: the tuberculin skin test. It’s a shot that scans for TB antibodies. If you’ve been exposed to the disease, the injection site on your forearm will flare up into a BRIGHT RED SKIN MOUNTAIN. The test is still part of routine checkups today among grade-schoolers, teachers, cops, and — as I would learn — Peace Corps volunteers.</p>\r\n<p>There is a photo of me on Facebook from early 2010, lodged between a handful of party shots with fellow volunteers. We had traveled to Kiev from across Ukraine to make a weekend out of our mid-service medical checkups. I’m 23, hamming it up in melodramatic distress, and twisting my left elbow up over my head to show off the swollen red splotch on my forearm.</p>\r\n<p>A positive skin test usually doesn’t mean you have TB — less than than 10% of people with positive skin tests ever develop an active case, because healthy immune systems can usually defeat the bacterial intruder. Several volunteers each year end up with the telltale red blotch; it was really nothing to worry about. We’d need a follow-up X-ray, but an active case was highly unlikely. So I cracked a few jokes and went back to pounding flat Chernigivske beers with my friends.</p>\r\n<p>I had been in Ukraine since September 2008, after studying Russian in college. I volunteered at a school in an eastern mining town called Antratsyt. The town borrows its name from anthracite coal. The region is flat, but you can see hills in the distance — they’re “slag heaps,” or piles of debris extracted from mines. The town only runs water for a few hours a day to protect the mines from mudslides or collapse. But life wasn’t as bleak as it sounds. I had students who were so excited to practice their English that they would chat with me after school, perched in a row on the edge of a Soviet-era fountain long-since bone-dry. I struck up friendships with their parents and my fellow teachers. I toasted my colleagues over champagne and chocolate on Ukrainian holidays. One time, I even gave a thickly accented speech on international education at a school assembly that ended up on the TV news. I was happy.</p>\r\n<p>My follow-up X-ray was two weeks later, in Kiev. Taking yet another 17-hour train trip felt like an epic hassle. Is there a word that means the opposite of hypochondriac? There should be, because that’s what I am. In hindsight, <i>of course</i> I had symptoms – I just wrote them off to other things. I had a bad cough, because I was a smoker at the time. I’d lost weight, because there was no American junk food to lose my will power around. I was run-down and sluggish, because it was the Ukrainian winter!</p>\r\n<p>I got a ride with Dr. Sasha, one of the Peace Corps’ Ukrainian staffers, to my screening at a tuberculosis dispensary — <i>tubdispensar</i> — on the edge of the city. He spoke the sort of English that made me self-conscious about my Russian. He carried my Peace Corps medical history file on his lap. The most dramatic thing in it was an allergy to mangoes. (Not exactly a significant handicap in Ukraine.)</p>\r\n<p>I was X-rayed in a machine that looked like an iron colossus. In the waiting room, I tried to distract myself with a biography of John Adams. (His son, John Quincy, spent years in the Russian Empire as Ambassador and managed to stay consumption-free.) Soviet-era medical facilities are much more dimly lit than their Walmart-bright American counterparts. To see the page, I had to squint.</p>\r\n<p>The head TB doctor finally called me into the office. He explained the X-ray results and prognosis to Dr. Sasha, who relayed them in English to me. But when Dr. Sasha asked a follow-up question, they flipped back to Russian and cut me out of the triangle. My Russian was good – but not “unfamiliar medical jargon” good. But this wasn’t a conversation I could stand to be excluded from. I was on the brink of a tantrum.</p>\r\n<p>“God<i>damn</i> it!<i>”</i> I wanted to shriek at the TB doc. “<i>Don’t</i> say it in <i>his</i> Russian. Say it in <i>mine.”</i></p>\r\n<p>My face must have looked like a cartoon teakettle. So he slowed down and turned toward the image pinned to the light board.</p>\r\n<p>“Classic pulmonary TB,” he said to me. (Words like <i>pulmonary</i> and <i>tuberculosis</i> are cognates.) “It’s strange that it advanced so quickly. Especially for a healthy young girl.”</p>\r\n<p>“Are you sure?” I asked. “I heard you guys muttering about bronchitis or pneumonia before. Could it be one of those?”</p>\r\n<p>“No. We assumed it could have been at first, but this is a clear case. See, on an X-ray, healthy lungs should look solid black. See the contrast down by the lower ribs? But now look up on the right. See the [blahblahblah]? The [blahblahblah] is the tuberculosis.”</p>\r\n<p>“I’m sorry. I didn’t get that word. <i>What</i> part is the tuberculosis?”</p>\r\n<p>He sighed. It would have been easier to let Dr. Sasha translate. Now he had to dumb down his lexicon for a rattled American.</p>\r\n<p>“Up there. Upper right. Well, left on here. That white spot? The part that looks like a ghost.”</p>\r\n<p>That night, I started treatment in a studio apartment the Peace Corps rented for me in Kiev. My prognosis was good. For two weeks, I took pills, got X-rayed, and hocked up sputum — a polite word for <i>loogies</i> — into sterile plastic cups for lab work. One set stayed in Ukraine; the other was shipped according to special biohazard protocol to an American facility to better coordinate my care at home.</p>\r\n<p>Eight weeks later, just as life was settling down back in Chicago, I was surprised to find an ominous number of missed calls on my phone: from the diagnostic lab, my mom, my American pulmonologist, my mom, the Cook County Department of Public Health, my mom, my mom, the Cook County Department of Public Health Epidemiology Unit, my mom, my mom, my mom, my mom, my mom.</p>\r\n<p>Those loogies had yielded bad news. I had XDR-TB. The bad kind.</p>\r\n<p>Effective immediately, I was placed under an isolation order. I was told to stay home whenever possible — I could go outside sparingly, but any other indoor space was off-limits until I was noninfectious. A few months, at least. The police could get involved if I didn’t comply.</p>\r\n<p>A month into my quarantine, my Chicago doctors were stumped. They’d rarely seen anything like this.</p>\r\n<p>So I set off on a journey not unlike those taken by consumptives a century before. I left my bustling, industrial Midwestern city and headed west, to the National Jewish Health Center in Denver.</p>\r\n<p>It was the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives back then. In 1899, the brand-new philanthropic institution was brimming with needy patients. In 2010, I was the only one.</p>\r\n<p>I told almost no one where I was going. I had already been avoiding friends who tried to contact me. It is exhausting to have your life flipped around by something people know nothing about. You get so damn sick of telling the story. Weird caveats demand exposition. <i>Here is what I have. Here is why it’s bad. Here is why I had to evacuate Ukraine and leave the Peace Corps early. Here is why I can’t be in public or see anyone for the foreseeable future. Here is why I am going to some hospital in Denver for a long time. Here is why they chopped off a big chunk of my lung.

But the truth is, public health measures like quarantine and mouth covering did more to eradicate tuberculosis than drugs did. We never did figure out a great way to cure TB; we just got better at preventing it. That is, until it caught up with us.</p>\r\n<p>After Dr. Koch’s splashy 1882 debut of the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis,</i> the medical community was certain a surefire solution was close behind. But they were disappointed. No cure came.</p>\r\n<p>Forty years later, a new vaccine — Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, or BCG — entered human testing. But BCG was never that good. Most researchers believe that adults are just as likely to wind up with TB whether they get BCG or not. It also suffered a major PR setback as the center of one of the worst vaccination disasters in history. In 1930, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749764/\">73 babies died of tuberculosis meningitis</a> after being injected with BCG in Lubeck, Germany. The vaccines had been contaminated after getting mixed up with a virulent live TB strain back at the lab. (Life hack: Always be <i>sure</i> your doctor has a label maker.)</p>\r\n<p>It wasn’t until 1943 that a <a href=\"http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/25252/title/The-discovery-of-streptomycin/\">team at Rutgers University</a> pinpointed streptomycin, the world’s first antibiotic effective against tuberculosis. TB’s staggering cultural legacy made the discovery a shoo-in for the Nobel Prize, but streptomycin was nonetheless terribly flawed. It was toxic, and patients quickly developed antibodies that resisted the drug. The only solution was to scrape around for more options and blitzkrieg every case of TB with several so-so drugs at once. The first-line regimen has hardly been tweaked in nearly 50 years. It was never a secret that such a long and tedious course of antibiotics would, like a Shakespearean hero, engineer its own demise.</p>\r\n<p>But that hardly seemed to matter. By the time streptomycin ‘n’ friends showed up, barely anyone even needed them. Throughout the 20th century, people gradually stopped getting TB in the first place. We got healthier, cleaner, and smarter. We could contain disease and catch it early. It nearly disappeared.</p>\r\n<p>Then, in the early 1990s, it bounced back. Two global crises — the rise of HIV/AIDS and the fall of the Soviet Union — helped resurrect the scourge of the 19th century. The World Health Organization declared a worldwide TB emergency in 1993. (It just goes to show: Don’t count your eradicated diseases before they hatch.)</p>\r\n<p>AIDS was even harder on human bodies than the Industrial Revolution had been, and millions of centuries-won immune systems were suddenly wide open to infection anew. TB remains the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/hiv/en/\">leading cause</a> of death among AIDS patients.</p>\r\n<p>The collapse of the USSR spread TB in even more complicated ways. The year 1991 saw the traumatic birth of 15 brand-new post-Soviet republics. Each of these new countries was in economic and social turmoil. They were broke. They had no central government or public health system. Before their independence, everything had more or less filtered through Moscow. In some places, there were few to no supplies or institutional infrastructure, let alone money for health care workers. Alcoholism and malnourishment soared. People lost their savings. Rampant crime stuffed the prisons — notorious hotbeds of TB — to well over capacity. Released inmates carted these germs back to their communities. By the time the 15 new countries had smoothed things out, they already had a new old epidemic to battle.</p>\r\n<p>Even as the immediate post-Soviet crisis improved, other factors played into treatment interruption and new infections. These have been beautifully documented by experts like Dr. Lee Reichman in his 2001 book <i>Timebomb</i> and are easily rattled off by every post-Soviet MDR expert I’ve come across. Treatment in prisons has been badly underfunded, so for years people didn’t get the meds they needed. There is often subpar follow-up for ill prisoners after they’re released. Infected migratory workers are tough to treat and track. The Soviet-era mentality of medical specialization has made the region slow to coordinate HIV and TB care. Both illnesses are also correlated with substance abuse, and addicts often turn out to be less-than-diligent patients. In sum, the long, hard treatment places economic, social, and physical strain on patients.</p>\r\n<p>Antibiotic treatment is an all-or-nothing game. Patients need to take every dose by the book, or germs acquire resistance. Getting it done right depends on stupendous public health programs, not to mention stupendous patients. Once a strain does acquire resistance, it can’t be undone — and the stronger, harder-to-treat germ is passed on to others, like me. If the best drugs don’t work, doctors are forced to use drugs that are even harder on the body. All of these factors collude to paint a grim reality. In former Soviet countries, <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/91355/1/9789241564656_eng.pdf?ua=1\">only around 60% of patients</a> who begin tuberculosis treatment ever successfully finish it. The rest of them flee, slip through the cracks, fail to respond to treatment, or die before they are cured.</p>\r\n<p>So it is no surprise that the region has the highest rates of MDR-TB in the world — <a href=\"http://www.pih.org/blog/tuberculosis-in-russia-a-qa-with-expert-oksana-ponomarenko\">as many as 30%</a> of all newly detected cases are impervious to first-line drugs. (The global average is reportedly <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr13_executive_summary.pdf?ua=1\">less than 5%</a>, but statistics are widely believed to be low, especially in resource-poor countries. In the U.S., there were <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6311a2.htm\">fewer than 100 cases</a> of MDR in 2013.) Even in optimal conditions, the difference between a case of run-of-the-mill TB and MDR can be the difference between a moderate inconvenience and a life-threatening catastrophe. A standard case can be cured for less than $100 with a daily dose of four different drugs for six to nine months. My treatment cost taxpayers seven figures and lasted well over two years.</p>\r\n<p>On paper, many of these problems have already been fixed. A decade ago, Tracy Kidder’s best-seller <a href=\"http://www.tracykidder.com/books/mountains/\"><i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i></a> lauded the achievements of Dr. Paul Farmer’s <a href=\"http://www.pih.org\">Partners in Health</a> and other global health organizations in revolutionizing worldwide MDR-TB care. The region’s TB programs are now relatively well-organized and padded with funding from global health mammoths like the <a href=\"http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>. There are detailed and standardized treatment guidelines. TB drugs are fully subsidized. So why are so many patients still failing their treatments?</p>\r\n<p>Without an <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/toward-an-effective-tuberculosis-vaccine/380807/\">effective vaccine</a> or better drugs, efforts to curb MDR-TB face a serious paradox. As a strain becomes more resistant, it becomes simultaneously more painful and more urgent to treat it. Many countries have responded by adopting stringent patient monitoring policies, which improve cure rates but are nonetheless no small imposition in patients’ lives. Public safety overrides patient agency, which is a tough pill for victims to swallow (and they’ve already got plenty of those to worry about).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw  \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042055\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/longform-4339-1413500894-18.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/longform-4339-1413500894-18.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"413\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 365px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042055','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:990px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042055','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"We never did figure out a way to cure TB; we just got better at preventing it.

Nausea became my baseline. Sometimes the drugs make you puke, or give you the kind of diarrhea that makes you need a nap. One screws with your nervous system, and I permanently lost most of the feeling in my feet. I’ve tracked blood across kitchen floors because I can’t tell if I’ve stepped on shattered glass.</p>\r\n<p>And I had it lucky. I had no comorbidities like HIV or diabetes, which make everything even worse. Being on amikacin cost me some low-frequency hearing, but it has caused deafness in others. And I got to take it by IV drip, instead of the painful upper-thigh injections that leave some patients too sore to sit up. And while cycloserine — a drug nicknamed “psychoserine” for its notorious mental and behavioral effects — makes some patients hallucinate and scream, I got away with confusion. I had trouble with reading, organization, and paperwork. It’s an especially tough break if you’re dealing with a workers’ comp claim for a medical disaster. I couldn’t keep it all straight, and walloped my credit.</p>\r\n<p>Even worse, most patients in former Soviet countries and across the world get practically no social support during the crisis. They get little help with side effects, and suffer serious social and economic strain. Many of them have no way to make up for lost wages over the course of their treatments. Some even face lasting discrimination. In 2011, <a href=\"http://dnews.donetsk.ua/2011/09/21/8967.html\">an undercover Ukrainian journalist</a> wrote an exposé about being iced out by hiring managers after casually mentioning a past bout of TB.</p>\r\n<p>The reason why boils down to one key factor: Tuberculosis remains highly stigmatized throughout the world. In the former Soviet Union, people associate it with painful memories of the lawless, chaotic ‘90s. Having it means you’re a crook, a junkie, a drunk, a bum, or a sewer rat.</p>\r\n<p>Stigma makes epidemics worse — it gives people a reason not to be seen walking into a clearly labeled TB clinic to see a doctor when they should. Loneliness and despair can convince someone that health doesn’t matter, so why take these pills? And stigma shuts people up, so they’ll never organize, influence funding, or change minds about TB. Stigma means more stigma.</p>\r\n<p>When patients are silenced and isolated from one another and their communities, it stymies progress against the disease. The WHO estimates more than a $1.3 billion worldwide <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tb/WHO_GF_TB_financing_factsheet.pdf\">funding gap in TB research and development</a>, and the number threatens to grow. Even though investment in new drug research is one obvious way to improve treatment, <a href=\"http://www.tbonline.info/media/uploads/documents/community_letter_to_astrazeneca_re_tb.pdf\">AstraZeneca</a>, Novartis, and Pfizer recently pulled a combined $50 million out of the fight. According to an email from the <a href=\"http://www.treatmentactiongroup.org\">Treatment Action Group</a>, a TB and HIV advocacy nonprofit, this steep loss amounts to a full third of private-sector TB investment since 2011.</p>\r\n<p>Erasing stigma, combating TB’s chronic underfunding, and promoting new research and drug development are incredibly lofty goals. But similar barriers have been conquered before in diseases like breast cancer and HIV/AIDS, where passionate activism made incredible inroads in raising awareness and influencing policy. If former and current TB patients joined together, could they build the first real advocacy movement centered on patients?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042061\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-17359-1413502421-5.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-17359-1413502421-5.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 1018px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042061','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-17359-1413502421-5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">llustration by Ashley Mackenzie for BuzzFeed</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Tuberculosis patients haven’t always felt so alone.</p>\r\n<p>After leaving Denver, I read <i>The Magic Mountain,</i> Thomas Mann’s sprawling 1924 classic novel about a Swiss sanatorium. I forced myself to finish it, but it’s the most boring book I’ve ever read. It’s the story of a total wiener named Hans Castorp who goes on a trip to hang out in the Alps and visit his TB-stricken cousin. Then Hans ends up sticking around and living there for seven years even though he doesn’t really have tuberculosis, just so he can do stupid crap like spend 70 pages talking about the nature of consciousness.</p>\r\n<p>Ugh, I’m still so <i>mad</i> at him. But maybe it’s because I’m a tiny bit jealous. So what if he’s a fake person with fake tuberculosis? It would have been so nice to have someone to be sick with.</p>\r\n<p>Sanatoriums, like National Jewish and the one atop <i>The Magic Mountain</i>, bridged the gap between the mid-19th century and the 1940s discovery of streptomycin. With no cure in sight, the ill had long made do with an iffy array of treatment options. Some doctors stuffed people’s windpipes with vacuum contraptions to simulate lazy lung capillaries. Cottage industries of miracle cures gorged on ad space in periodicals, sandwiched among serial installments of now beloved classics. (If you liked <i>Great Expectations</i>, you’ll love Daffy &amp; Son’s Natural Miracle Multi-Purpose Health Elixir! Available wherever fancy wool top hats and snuff boxes are sold!!!<i>)</i> But the White Plague seemed to beat them all.</p>\r\n<p>Tuberculosis did have one semi-formidable opponent, though — one hope that physicians agreed on. It wasn’t a cure; it wasn’t a given. The idea came from an <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=HtkDAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">1840 pamphlet</a> written by Dr. George Bodington, a British family doctor who covered a large area by making his house calls on horseback. His essay was based on a simple observation: that consumptives in wide-open spaces fared better than those packed tightly in cities.</p>\r\n<p>But Dr. Bodington drew a further conclusion: It must have been the country air that healed them. Their bodies need pure, unsoiled air, shared with as few people as possible. Depending on the severity of their case, they might need months or years of it. In the disease’s final stages, <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> finally chews through the lung tissue, resulting in the bloody cough that famously beckoned death (but, curiously, couldn’t stop the heroines of <i>Les Misérables</i>, <i>La Bohème,</i> and <i>La Traviata</i> from singing). If combated early with the right dose of air, the process could drag to a halt.</p>\r\n<p>And where could patients find such magic air? The best stuff was nippy, clean, and thin. Way up high, where no one can spoil it with industrial factory smog. And so, for the next 100 years, sick city-dwellers left their crowded hubs by the thousands and set off for specialized tuberculosis hospitals in the mountains. These sanatoriums treated patients with Dr. Bodington’s “rest cure” — medical observation, a generous binge diet, and hours a day in rows of canopied outdoor beds. In <i>The</i> <i>Magic Mountain,</i> characters traveled to Switzerland from places like England, Italy, and Poland. For months or years at a time, consumptives at sanatoriums lived and breathed together far away from real life, in their own little communities up in the sky.</p>\r\n<p>Denver — the Mile High City, full of its own magic mountains — thus became America’s magnet for the dying who wanted to live. In the late 19th century, <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_6024584\">nearly a third</a> of Colorado’s population suffered from tuberculosis, after journeying west for the air that might save them. At the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives, they slept two by two, tucked into each of its dozens of bunk beds.</p>\r\n<p>By the time I showed up, the bunk beds were long gone. There were no pretty canopies or breezy napping patios. And all that oh-so-edifying “virgin air” stuff? Turned out to be bunk. The bump in survival rates among patients who spent all that time outdoors wasn’t because of the air; it was the sun. Vitamin D is good for the immune system. They could have gotten the same effect on the roof of a tenement house. Or by taking sunshine stuffed into Vitamin D pills, like I did, supplemented by the UV light in my hospital room. (In a 21st century American city, you don’t just let a case of active tuberculosis run around outside.) Other times, patients’ health improved simply because sanatoriums gave them a badly needed break from lives of poverty and labor.</p>\r\n<p>Still, the sanatorium era continues to be considered a public health success. Not because sanatoriums ever did much to help “lungers.” But because they kept them away from healthy people. By shooing contagious patients off to remote treatment complexes, Dr. Bodington had inadvertently pioneered the concept of infection control. Keeping sick people away from vulnerable populations seems so obvious now. But back then, would the idea of germs — invisible, flying disease pods — have sounded any less silly than magic air?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw  \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042063\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-8518-1413501196-21.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-8518-1413501196-21.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"363\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 315px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042063','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:990px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042063','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"From the 18th century to today, TB went from being a universal human experience to a profoundly lonely one.\"'>\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3480022_4042063','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"From the 18th century to today, TB went from being a universal human experience to a profoundly lonely one.\"'>\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3480022_4042063','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"From the 18th century to today, TB went from being a universal human experience to a profoundly lonely one.\"'>\r\n\t\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-8518-1413501196-21.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Tuberculosis treatment in 1942 </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">D.

My mom made the appointment. I didn’t really want to go; I’ve never liked therapy.</p>\r\n<p>But I hated doing this to my mom. This wasn’t just my crisis; it was my family’s too. And it was harder on my mom than anyone. She’d just spent 10 days next to me on a cot in the Denver ICU after my first lung surgery went wrong. She’d held my hand when the stiff chest tube draining blood from my lungs made breathing hurt so badly I got tunnel vision. She’d lost so much weight and was thinner than I’d ever seen her. So when she kept insisting that I talk to someone, I figured I could force myself to muster an hour of sincerity. And if I didn’t like it, I could lie, quit, and just find my own answers in some book.</p>\r\n<p>I got to the office and we made our introductions. Then I broke the ice.</p>\r\n<p>“Has anyone ever told you that you look like Laura Linney?” I asked.</p>\r\n<p>She paused. For too long.“No. I’ve actually never gotten that.”</p>\r\n<p>“No. I’ve actually never gotten that.”</p>\r\n<p><i>BULLSHIT. She looks</i> exactly <i>like Laura Linney.</i></p>\r\n<p>“I spoke to your mother on the phone. She said you contracted tuberculosis while you were in the Peace Corps in Russia?”</p>\r\n<p>“No, I was in Ukraine. But yes. I mean, it was the Far East. The Russian-speaking part.”</p>\r\n<p>“And so you’re going through chemo now? How long is that?”</p>\r\n<p>“Well, I was hospitalized in Denver and got the part of my lung removed with the TB on it last month. So now I’m on chemo. It’s the IV drip. None of the radiation stuff. And I never lost my hair. So I don’t know if it even counts. I have nine months of that, and a total of two years or so on everything else.”</p>\r\n<p><i>OK, it’s not like I’m uniquely hyperaware of Laura Linney or something. There’s no way I could be the first person to notice.</i></p>\r\n<p>“And then…it goes away?” she asked.</p>\r\n<p><i>Wait, is she pissed? Why? It’s a compliment, right? Hold on. Does she just, like, hate Laura Linney?</i></p>\r\n<p>“Knock on wood. It can come back, hypothetically,” I recited. “That’s why they treat it so aggressively. They just want to make sure that it’s really, really dead. But they can’t, like, promise you anything.”</p>\r\n<p>I went back once or twice for additional sessions. I tried to explain that I wasn’t scared about dying or anything. By then, doctors seemed confident that I wouldn’t. But I had this anxiety I couldn’t shake. I wanted closure in Ukraine, and the people in my town. I wanted to be moving toward something. I tried to convert the emotional fallout into a momentum that more closely resembled psychosis. I took 36 practice LSATs but was hospitalized the day of the test. But panic was a problem I couldn’t obsess my way out of. I’d pick up a book but just hold it in my lap and forget what the hell it was for. I had no job and no idea what to do with myself. I lived with my parents, who at that moment seemed to be trying to keep me alive by never letting me out of their sight. I felt timid and stuck. I felt cheated out of that rosy immortality my friends had. All those toxic meds made me feel like someone else. I was very, very tired. And I felt like I was failing. I wanted my sense of control back. I was so damn sad.</p>\r\n<p>My mom picked that therapist because she specializes in treating patients with life-interrupting illnesses, like MS or cancer.</p>\r\n<p>“It can be hard for people to lose their control,” the therapist told me. “Here’s something I suggest that people can do to feel like they have some power over everything. Next time you go for an infusion, try to close your eyes and think of the chemicals in the drugs coursing through you, attacking all of the bad cells. And concentrate on them, and <i>really</i> see them. Then, envision the chemo forcing them out of your body. Picture them floating away.”</p>\r\n<p>I skipped my next appointment and never rescheduled. It wasn’t a therapist that I wanted. I wanted to connect with other patients like me.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042069\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-840-1413500295-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-840-1413500295-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"1289\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 1241px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042069','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-840-1413500295-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">llustration by Ashley Mackenzie for BuzzFeed</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m not the only person to conclude that TB patients may be uniquely equipped to help each other. In 1907, a Boston-area internist named Dr. Joseph Pratt had the same idea while searching for innovative treatment alternatives for TB patients who couldn’t afford faraway sanatoriums. He had the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2112765\">hippy-dippy idea</a> that bringing patients together could replicate the revitalizing effects of places like the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives, and help patients heal. Couldn’t they guide each other through the experience better than any doctor could?</p>\r\n<p>Pratt tested his hunch with a trial of a dozen patients. Modern medicine’s first recorded support group was deemed a success. Moral support really did help combat tuberculosis. His destitute patients had made do without the magic air that wasn’t really magic and replaced it with something that was.</p>\r\n<p>That’s one thing the sanatorium era got right that today’s TB control programs get wrong: the need for community. Today, the sanatorium era is thought of as a relic of medical quackery rendered moot by modern science. But to mock it in favor of enlightened antibiotic cures is to dismiss the lived experience of patients. For all their problems, sanatoriums were designed to heal patients. Today, treatment is primarily concerned with limiting threats posed to others. Patients’ lives are collateral damage.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042128\" rel:buzz_num=\"11\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-buzz-wide-10741-1413501020-26.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-buzz-wide-10741-1413501020-26.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"328\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 280px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:11\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042128','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-buzz-wide-10741-1413501020-26.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>I showed up at the radiology department of George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C., for my final chest X-ray in late spring of 2012. I stood in the yellow foot outlines and assumed the TSA body scan position without even waiting for the technician’s spiel.</p>\r\n<p>“Oh, you’re an old pro, then!” he said from the processing room. “OK, deep breath and hold it… Good… Now let’s just make sure that… <i>Whoa,</i> you’re missing a big part of your lung! Sorry, wasn’t expecting that!” That makes two of us.</p>\r\n<p>But the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> had indeed been destroyed. What was left of my lungs showed up as solid black — just as a healthy X-ray is supposed to be.</p>\r\n<p>But somehow, it wasn’t as satisfying as I’d hoped. Once again, I wanted to share the moment with someone who understood what it meant. Moral support is nice for the good stuff too.</p>\r\n<p>I began to find out how many patients felt the same way in June 2013, when I finally went back to Ukraine. I made a ring around the country to gather data for my master’s thesis: I traveled to Kiev, Lviv, Crimea, Mariupol, Kharkhiv, Lugansk, Donetsk, and my beloved Antratsyt. I visited hospitals, clinics, and met doctors, health care and nonprofit workers, and, of course, patients. No matter who they were, tuberculosis had a profound impact on their lives. Many had lost friends or even family members over their illness, or felt forced to keep the experience secret. Loneliness and shame were practically the default.</p>\r\n<p>For as long as I’d spent surviving and learning about tuberculosis, one big question stuck in the back of my mind. I posed it to Oksana Viktorovna, a training coordinator for the <a href=\"http://stoptb.in.ua/en/\">Stop TB in Ukraine</a> initiative in Donetsk. Why, I asked her, is there so little communication and coordination within the TB patient community, and so much of it — working successfully, by the way — in other diseases?</p>\r\n<p>“You’re right,” she told me. “People are ashamed to be associated with the fringe. And even though TB is curable, the stigma makes them think it would be better to have cancer.” And perhaps, she continued, people who survive TB are ready to forget it and move on.</p>\r\n<p>But, this might be changing, Oksana said. Lately, she’d noticed a few groups pop up online, on Russian networking sites like LiveJournal and VKontakte. Some people even created entirely new accounts to be able to discuss their lives with tuberculosis anonymously. “They write about their experience, their worries, their questions,” Oksana told me. “It seems to increase their optimism. I think it helps them get better.”</p>\r\n<p>The clandestine online TB clubs were easy to find. As soon as I started poking through them, I found someone my age from Khabarovsk, Russia, whom I felt like I already knew.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw  \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042124\" rel:buzz_num=\"10\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-wide-29875-1413500990-20.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-wide-29875-1413500990-20.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"381\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 333px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:10\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042124','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:990px;\">\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042124','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"Stigma shuts people up so they'll never organize, influence funding or change minds.

Even in the tourist-thick crowd by the famous Tretyakov Gallery, she wasn’t hard to spot. By now we’d already spent hours of our lives talking on Skype.</p>\r\n<p>Ksenia maintains a <a href=\"http://stoptub.livejournal.com\">patient-centered website</a> about TB, as well as pages in English and Russian across several social media platforms. Her project’s slogan, “Being ill isn’t shameful,” challenges the negative cultural narratives about TB and the people who have it. Visitors can read the blog she kept during her treatment and her interviews with doctors and survivors. She regularly interacts with new patients from all over the world.</p>\r\n<p>Social media has the potential to finally address the long-standing need for support among TB patients. Last month, Doctors Without Borders <a href=\"http://www.msf.org/article/msf-study-highlights-potential-social-media-support-mdr-tb-patients\">published a study</a> that identified serious benefits for users of these online platforms, including <a href=\"http://blogs.msf.org/en/patients/blogs/tb-me\">TB &amp; Me</a>, the organization’s own blogging portal. Social media, <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0108591\">they conclude</a>, helps MDR patients adhere to treatment, gain back a sense of control, fight feelings of despair and solitude, and educate health care providers and the public. After treatment, survivors like Ksenia can continue to serve as mentors and advocates for the global patient community.</p>\r\n<p>I strolled with Ksenia across the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge, along the edge of Red Square, and up the fabled Arbat Street.

Even as he ran for office in 2010, he faced criminal charges for <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304727-co-arrest-declaration.html\">renting out apartments that were slummy and unsafe</a>. Midway through his first term, he was caught on tape taking $2.36 million in cash from an undercover agent he thought was a land developer. Co told the agent that for enough money he would vote “yes” on any land-use plans. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304718-copleaagreement.html\">“I don’t care if it’s the shittiest can of worms,” Co said.</a></p>\r\n<p>Despite Moreno Valley’s depressed property values, control over its land is actually worth a fortune. Indeed, nearly every major retailer in the world covets the kind of real estate the city offers: empty acres near freeways and train tracks at the epicenter of one of the largest but least noticed land rushes in America.</p>\r\n<p>This arid flatland, shimmering and indistinct in the heat and smog, is just perfect for warehouses. These are not, however, warehouses as most people think of them. These are massive, <a href=\"http://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/pdfs/SupplyChainRBR_B.pdf\">futuristic</a> behemoths that have proliferated on a scale seen nowhere else on the continent to usher in goods from Asia to consumers across a vast swath of the United States.</p>\r\n<p>Americans have grown to expect the goods they want delivered to their homes or nearby store shelves within days or hours. But all this two-day shipping, click-to-ship, and get-it-on-your-doorstep-by-noon-tomorrow has come at a price, paid by the people who live in the shadows of the mega-warehouses: lung-stunting, cancer-causing pollution and, in some cases, political corruption.</p>\r\n<p>The underside of our consumer economy can be seen in a tale of two cities, just 20 miles apart. There is Moreno Valley, where developers have shoveled in money to win the political approvals to build new warehouses. And there is Mira Loma, a tiny community already awash in warehouses and suffering some of the worst pollution in America.</p>\r\n<p>“Everyone wants a new flat-screen TV,” said Ed Avol, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine who has spent the last two decades studying the effects of air pollution on children. “Everyone wants new clothing. But nobody thinks about how it got [to them.]”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4030948\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/15/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-13883-1413400594-18.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/15/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-13883-1413400594-18.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1038\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 990px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:1\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4030948','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/15/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-13883-1413400594-18.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Warehouses line both sides of Etiwanda Avenue as it stretches out into the Inland Empire. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Jesse Kaplan for BuzzFeed News / Via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://jessekaplanphoto.com\">jessekaplanphoto.com</a></span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreno Valley and Mira Loma lie in the vast sprawl east of Los Angeles known as the Inland Empire.

Most of that cargo then moves through the Inland Empire. It either passes through or stops off at distribution centers serving Amazon, Wal-Mart Stores, Target, Costco, Home Depot, Restoration Hardware, Baskin-Robbins, Nike, Nordstrom, Kraft Foods, Toys ‘R’ Us, Ford, BMW… the list goes on and on.</p>\r\n<p>If you live anywhere in the United States west of about Chicago, and you eat, wear, watch, play, sit on, or drive a product bought retail in recent years, chances are good that it came through this area.</p>\r\n<p>And if you live in the Inland Empire, you’ve watched giant flat-roofed buildings that resemble alien spaceships march across the landscape with a speed some compare to a raging forest fire.</p>\r\n<p>There is now enough industrial space in Riverside and San Bernardino counties — the two counties that make up the Inland Empire — to enclose almost half of Manhattan. Industry experts estimate that the area needs at least 15 million additional square feet every year just to keep pace with demand.</p>\r\n<p>That, in and of itself, might not be so bad for the air.

What it does have are 90 warehouses and a whole lot of big rigs: <a href=\"http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-seeks-join-suit-protect-public-health-mira-loma\">Trucks rumble through 15,000 times <i>every day</i></a>. In just half an hour on a recent afternoon, 269 trucks passed by the big plate glass window in the front of the Farmer Boys truck stop on Etiwanda Avenue.</p>\r\n<p>That is more than one every seven seconds.</p>\r\n<p>Avol, the professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, began visiting the town in the early 1990s as part of a study of air pollution and children’s health across Southern California. Back then, he said, researchers chose Mira Loma because it sits at the “end of the tailpipe” of the Los Angeles basin, meaning the prevailing winds off the Pacific Ocean blow L.A.’s infamous smog east until much of it arrives in Mira Loma. So it was rural yet had a lot of ozone and smog. Other places in the study, such as Santa Barbara and Long Beach, were picked because they were thought to boast clean air or because they were in industrial areas.</p>\r\n<p>When the study began, Mira Loma residents complained to researchers about the smell of dairy cows, herds of which clustered on vast pastures and cow yards. But in 1987, Riverside county supervisors revamped the general plan for Mira Loma, clearing the way for massive warehouse development.</p>\r\n<p>“In the course of a few years, the dairies disappeared,” and what had been “open pasture became streets and warehouses, lined with trucks,” Avol said. “Mira Loma turned out to be a very interesting place to study.”</p>\r\n<p>The trucks made the already bad air worse, bringing in diesel particulates, very small particles that can enter the lungs and travel to tissues throughout the body. They are associated with asthma, heart disease, neurological problems, and cancer.</p>\r\n<p>In Mira Loma, children were found to be growing up with stunted lungs compared with children living in places with better air. Their lungs were growing at a rate that was 1 to 1.5% slower, Avol said, so that “after their teen years, they were about 10 to 12% lower in lung function than children who had grown up in cleaner places.”</p>\r\n<p>He added: “We have no information at this point that supports the idea that they ever catch up.”</p>\r\n<p>Studies from other Inland Empire communities are also dire. In a neighborhood near the BNSF rail yard in the city of San Bernardino, Loma Linda University researchers <a href=\"http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/clean-air-plans/clean-communities-plan/enrrich-final-presentation-6-24-14.pdf?sfvrsn=2\">found</a> that adults have more respiratory problems, and children alarmingly high rates of asthma, even when compared with other polluted communities.</p>\r\n<p>Warehouse industry officials, along with Barry Wallerstein, the head of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, insist that it is possible to build jumbo warehouses that do not pose a threat to public health. The key, Wallerstein said, is taking steps such as requiring that “clean” trucks service them and ensuring that traffic going in and out does not abut residential areas.</p>\r\n<p>And yet, time and again, records and interviews show, officials failed to consider health impacts when approving warehouses.</p>\r\n<p>A 2002 investigation by the <i>Riverside Press Enterprise</i>, the local paper, examined the dozens of warehouses approved to be built in Mira Loma between 1987 and 2000. County planners <a href=\"http://www.pe.com/articles/air-750218-county-pollution.html?page=1\">couldn’t point to a single one</a> in which they had required a detailed environmental study.</p>\r\n<p>A spokesman for the county said it has “improved environmental protection,” and indeed as lawsuits from environmentalists and disconcerting health studies have piled up, officials across the Inland Empire have been ordering environmental reviews. But that doesn’t mean they turn down developers’ requests for more warehouses.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, Riverside County officials voted to allow a 1-million-plus-square-foot complex on one of the last pieces of vacant land near Mira Loma Village despite a study that found it would pose health risks to the people living there.</p>\r\n<p>A local environmental group, the Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice, sued. California Attorney General Kamala Harris <a href=\"http://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press_releases/n256_mira_loma_proposed_complaint_in_intervention.pdf?\">joined the suit</a> on the side of environmentalists.</p>\r\n<p>The two sides <a href=\"http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-settlement-protect-public-health\">reached a settlement last</a> year that allowed development to proceed but required local officials and the developer to make the project “greener,” with electric vehicle charging stations and even a potential prohibition on trucks on the road closest to the village.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement also contained a provision that feels ripped from the pages of dystopian fiction: Every home in the village would be offered high-tech air filters so residents could avoid breathing the polluted air right outside their windows.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4031743\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19704-1413412141-33.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19704-1413412141-33.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"978\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 930px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4031743','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19704-1413412141-33.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Lillyana Carrasco is pictured here with her father, Daniel Carrasco, as she leans on a new air filter at their family’s home in Mira Loma, California, on July 12.

Just one-fifth of adults over age 25 have a bachelor’s degree. When people are desperate for jobs, thousands of trucks driving through their community every day seems more tolerable.</p>\r\n<p>Then there is the money: Warehouse developers and the retailers that buy or lease from them have it. When they come in, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1306421-economic-impact-on-cities.html\"></a>they bring <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1306421-economic-impact-on-cities.html\">tax revenues to cash-starved local governments</a>.</p>\r\n<p>And developers donate to the political campaigns of politicians who control land-use approvals. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304718-copleaagreement.html\">Unlike the bribe Councilman Co took</a>, much if not most of the money surely flows through legal channels in the form of campaign contributions. But it’s hard to find an elected official in the Inland Empire who hasn’t benefited significantly, and in some cases overwhelmingly, from development interests.</p>\r\n<p>That was certainly the case in Moreno Valley. Population 200,000, the exurb sits 65 miles from Los Angeles. At the eastern edge of town, houses peter out into a dusty brown expanse, stretching to the horizon.</p>\r\n<p>The flat land, right by a freeway, is the site of developer Iddo Beneevi’s audacious plan to build what may well be the nation’s largest warehouse complex, a 41-million-square-foot colossus equivalent to 700 football fields called <a href=\"http://theworldlogisticscenter.com/multimedia/\">The World Logistics Center</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Long before the undercover FBI operative bribed Councilman Co (and then arrested him), Benzeevi methodically bought land — the city estimates he owns or controls about half the developable land in town — and helped build a political machine in this city.</p>\r\n<p>Benzeevi, as he will tell just about anyone who asks and even some who don’t, believes that “the logistics industry” is the inevitable next step in the evolution of human economic development, the end of a line of progress that leads from agrarian society to the great colonial empires to Apple, which, he claimed, can be seen as just a really cool logistics company.</p>\r\n<p>So far, he acknowledged, Moreno Valley has not been a hotbed of economic innovation. But with his help, he insisted, the city can put itself at the center of world commerce.</p>\r\n<p>Benzeevi has an exquisitely courteous manner, even with those who disagree with him, and a fancier style of dress — suits or pressed shirts — than that favored by most who frequent Moreno Valley City Hall. His long-winded fervor on the benefits of the logistics economy is so well known it is something of a joke in town.</p>\r\n<p>But until fairly recently his focus, like that of so many other developers, was on high-end homes that would rise up from the dry scrub as they had in so many other Inland Empire communities before the housing crash.</p>\r\n<p>In 2005, Benzeevi, reportedly working with Florida-based developer Jules Trump (no relation to the Donald), won approvals for “Aquabella,” an upscale community that would feature estates built around artificial lakes — “real resort living, without the hotel,” Benzeevi <a href=\"http://www.builderonline.com/design/projects/boomerangst_o\">told</a> one publication.</p>\r\n<p>He even helped convince the Moreno Valley City Council to rename the part of the city that would include the Aquabella community to “Rancho Belago” — the fact that “Belago” is not a word in English, Spanish, Italian, or any other common language didn’t deter anyone, nor did one resident’s complaint that it sounded <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312211-press-enterprise-rancho-belgao.html\">“goofy” and “like a casino from Las Vegas.”</a></p>\r\n<p>Rancho Belago signs were eventually put up all over the eastern end of town — although they were modified slightly from the original design after the city of Beverly Hills complained that they looked an awful lot like their iconic town signs. They still look very similar.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_narrow image_lfcn no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3479104_4031992\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rubbable-container\">\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/16/enhanced/webdr11/anigif_longform-original-15132-1413405937-9.gif\" width=\"720\" height=\"477\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/16/enhanced/webdr11/anigif_longform-original-15132-1413405937-9.gif\" rel:version=\"201411141357\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" alt=\"Warehouse Empire\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/16/enhanced/webdr11/anigif_longform-original-15132-1413405937-9.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Macey Foronda/BuzzFeed (Rancho Belago), Flickr: Thom Watson/Creative Commons / Via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thomwatson/1440977091\">Flickr: thomwatson</a></span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The grand project, <a href=\"http://www.aquabella.com/vision.html\">designed to have “all the charm of an Italian Renaissance village</a>,” was never built. The housing market buckled and crashed, and around six years ago Benzeevi and Trump swiveled to warehouses.</p>\r\n<p>It is easy to understand why. Appetite for warehouse space in the Inland Empire is so voracious that it’s almost sure money — if one can get the land-use approvals and permissions to build.</p>\r\n<p>“It takes forever to get it approved” in California, said Kim Snyder, president of the southwest region for San Francisco-based Prologis, one of the world’s largest developers of distribution centers. “And then sometimes you get sued twice along the way because of some environmental group that contends the wild bunnies won’t have a place to go, or the desert kangaroo or the burrowing owl or what have you.”</p>\r\n<p>For a retailer that needs space quickly, embarking on such a tortuous approval process can make little sense.</p>\r\n<p>So, in contrast to much of the rest of the country, warehouses in the Inland Empire tend to be built on spec, meaning that land developers such as Benzeevi build them and then find companies to rent them — which has never been easier because the <a href=\"http://ar2013.prologisweb.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312846-prologis2.html\">gap between supply and</a> demand has never been greater. In just the first eight months of this year, industry experts said, companies snapped up 15 million square feet of warehouse space.</p>\r\n<p>Basically, the business boils down to this: Get approval to build, then watch the profits roll in. Several industry experts estimate that profit margins are consistently in the high teens.</p>\r\n<p>In that context, a developer might like to have as much influence over the land use process as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033060\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/22/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-31029-1413426703-5.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/22/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-31029-1413426703-5.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1059\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1011px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033060','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/22/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-31029-1413426703-5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">The Skechers factory store and warehouse in Moreno Valley, California. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Macey J.

Way up. And he did not hesitate to pour money into campaigns against those who questioned his new plans.</p>\r\n<p>“It’s a sad state of affairs that money can practically buy a city,” said former Councilman Frank West. Records show that a Benzeevi-backed political action committee spent more than <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312481-moreno-valley-taxpayers-association.html\">$60,000</a> against West and for his opponent. West said he had disappointed Benzeevi by surveying his constituents about whether they wanted a mega-warehouse in their neighborhood. West posed the question as the shoe company Skechers’ national distribution center, developed by Benzeevi, came before the council.</p>\r\n<p>Benzeevi said that he dumped money into the 2008 campaign because the town was “stagnating” and to counter “myths.” Residents, he said, had grown weary of West “cashing in at City Hall while little if anything was happening in Moreno Valley, except for rising crime.”</p>\r\n<p>“We participate in our American democratic process,” he declared, and “the voters make the choices.”</p>\r\n<p>West lost the election. Those still on the council, he said, could hardly miss the point: “If there wasn’t total compliance with Benzeevi’s plan, he had the resources to remove you.”</p>\r\n<p>The Skechers warehouse was approved, and then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger <a href=\"http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=14626\">came to the 2010 groundbreaking</a>. The governor mused out loud that he wished Skechers would “create some maybe alligator cowboy boot running shoes.”</p>\r\n<p>The warehouse, <a href=\"http://www.moreno-valley.ca.us/community/news/news_13/031313skechers.html\">which city officials</a> touted as the largest certified green building of its kind in the United States, is more than half a mile long.</p>\r\n<p>In 2008 alone, campaign finance records show that one of Benzeevi’s companies, Highland Fairview, donated or loaned <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312481-moreno-valley-taxpayers-association.html\">more than $260,000</a> to local races that, for years before his arrival on the scene, had been won with far lower expenditures. Another big contributor was a land broker close to Benzeevi, Jerome Stephens, who kicked in more than $100,000.</p>\r\n<p>The men did not give their money directly to candidates. Instead, they donated it to a political action committee. In the close-knit ways of small-town politics, that committee had multiple connections to city power brokers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033571\" rel:buzz_num=\"15\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-30796-1413416511-22.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-30796-1413416511-22.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"423\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 375px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:15\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033571','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-30796-1413416511-22.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Moreno Valley City Councilman Richard Stewart </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Macey J.

At one point, the law firm rented an office suite at Raceway.</p>\r\n<p>Things even got more entwined. In 2008, as the real estate market headed steeply down, the general manager of Raceway Ford, Tom Owings, sold his four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom home with a pool and spa in the more upscale community of Redlands and moved into a rental house at the edge of the town in Moreno Valley.</p>\r\n<p>Less than two years later, he was appointed to the planning commission, and in 2012, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1314017-owings460-063012.html\">with the aid of campaign contributions</a> from Benzeevi’s ally Stephens, he was elected to the city council. He also received $10,000 from Skechers, which was later <a href=\"http://www.fppc.ca.gov/press_release.php?pr_id=779\">fined</a> $2,400 by the California Fair Political Practices Commission for improperly failing to report that and other contributions.</p>\r\n<p>Owings told BuzzFeed News that he sought political office because he believed he could “improve the city’s financial position and make it a better place to live.”</p>\r\n<p>But moving from a grand home in Redlands to a rental in Moreno Valley was notable to some in town, because that is not the usual trajectory for those not in economic distress. And Owings appeared to be doing just fine. According to a <a href=\"http://www.fppc.ca.gov/form700/2012/City/F-M/R_Owings_Thomas.pdf\">financial disclosure form</a> he filed covering the year 2012, Owings had various streams of income including a salary of more than $100,000 from Raceway Ford. He also held between $100,000 and $1 million in various investments.</p>\r\n<p>Owings said he changed his residence because his grandchildren, who had been living with him, moved away, and his house in Redlands was too big. He also wanted to sell it before the housing market crashed even further, he said, and Moreno Valley was closer to his office.</p>\r\n<p>“Snobbish” is how he described people who questioned his move. “People in Moreno Valley are like the people I grew up with, and I feel more comfortable in Moreno Valley,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>Last year, Owings became mayor of Moreno Valley, a position that rotates among council members.</p>\r\n<p>The former car salesman, who looks a bit like an off-duty Santa Claus and is often seen in the company of his golden retriever Shiloh, quickly became known for his snappish temper and habit of berating people who disagreed with him.</p>\r\n<p>Owings said that he wasn’t beholden to Benzeevi and acted independently of him. But he was viewed as a staunch ally of Benzeevi’s, a perception that was fed not only by his voting record but also by statements attacking critics of the World Logistics Center.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033156\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-28488-1413413042-13.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-28488-1413413042-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1060\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1012px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033156','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-28488-1413413042-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Moreno Valley City Council meeting. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Macey J.

Councilman Jesse Molina, who had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312481-moreno-valley-taxpayers-association.html\">received campaign donations</a> from the Benzeevi-funded political action committee<b>,</b> <a href=\"http://www.pe.com/articles/city-644004-valley-moreno.html\">told the Chamber of Commerce</a> in 2012 that he had dreamed of the World Logistics Center his entire life. (Later, he said he meant that he dreamed of a vision for that part of town.)</p>\r\n<p>Co, the councilman caught on camera taking money from the FBI, was also often supportive of Benzeevi, although in private he could be less than complimentary about development projects to which he intended to give his vote. During a taped conversation with the undercover FBI agent in the spring of 2012, he confided that he had promised a developer “<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304718-copleaagreement.html#document/p32/a178655\">he would always vote ‘yes’ on the developer’s projects even if it was a ‘pissing can.’”</a> The federal affidavit does not identify the developer.</p>\r\n<p>Benzeevi himself said the humungous World Logistics Center represents a chance for Moreno Valley to escape poverty and the long commutes so many residents must make because there are so few jobs in town.</p>\r\n<p>“Moreno Valley has a historic opportunity,” he said in an interview with BuzzFeed News. Life for many of its citizens, he said, is difficult, buffeted by low-paying jobs, endless hours on the freeway, and a choice between making ends meet and paying proper attention to children who must be left alone for hours on end while their parents commute.</p>\r\n<p>The World Logistics Center, he said, would solve many of those problems. He projects it would create 20,000 permanent jobs and another 13,000 construction jobs, and that it would be the largest “sustainable” development in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, top city officials had been pressuring staff to push through approvals for Benzeevi’s projects, even though some of his plans violated the city’s building code procedures, according <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312216-earlycase.html#document/p10/a182306\">to a lawsuit</a> filed last year by three former city staffers.</p>\r\n<p>Those employees claimed they were also under pressure to go easy on a criminal code enforcement case the city had filed against Councilman Co before he won office. His properties had multiple troubles. For example, he rented out an illegally converted garage to not one, but two families with children. After <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304727-co-arrest-declaration.html\">a child was injured in that</a> garage in 2010, building inspectors found a host of problems including dangerous wiring and substandard construction. The lawyer in charge of his defense in the code enforcement case was none other than Geller, the treasurer for the Benzeevi-backed political action committee.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033361\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-4135-1413414476-6.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-4135-1413414476-6.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1060\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1012px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033361','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-4135-1413414476-6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">A construction site in Moreno Valley. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Macey J.

(Benzeevi told BuzzFeed News “we have been working diligently” to improve the project, and “judgment should be reserved” until the final environmental review.)</p>\r\n<p>Some were also angry that the Skechers project, which backers had said <a href=\"http://highlandfairviewbusinesspark.com/index.html\">could create 2,500 new jobs</a>, in fact employed only about 600 — and many of those were people who had been relocated from the company’s old warehouse in a neighboring city.</p>\r\n<p>Last month <a href=\"http://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/pdfs/SupplyChainRBR_B.pdf\"><i>Robotics Business Review</i></a> hailed the Skechers warehouse as being at “the vanguard” in using new technologies that rely on robots and automation instead of workers for much of the labor within its smooth, white walls. The article noted that the new technologies allowed the company to cut its staffing by nearly 75%.</p>\r\n<p>Asked about those figures and other matters, Lauren Dutko, public relations manager for the company said in an email: “Skechers has no comment for the story.”</p>\r\n<p>Benzeevi called complaints about the number of jobs at Skechers “another attempt to disparage us based on lies and misrepresentations.” He said there were 1,000 jobs projected at the Skechers warehouse and 2,500 in total at the development, which includes two approved but not-yet-built offices.</p>\r\n<p>Around the Inland Empire, some have also begun to question the quality of warehouse jobs. Inland Empire economist John Husing, a consultant to local governments and businesses, said <a href=\"http://www.laedc.org/sclc/documents/GM_Husing-whitepaper.pdf\">research shows that</a> the median <a href=\"http://www.johnhusing.com/QER%20Reports/QER%20Oct%202013%20web.pdf\">income</a> in the industry is nearly $44,000 — one of the few routes to the middle class in the region for those without a college degree. Many warehouse developers and municipal economic development officials agree with that assessment. But some researchers argue that this rosy analysis <a href=\"http://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/WarehouseWorkerPay_web.pdf\">doesn’t include</a> contractors and temp workers, who make up a large portion of warehouse workers. Advocates maintain that many of these jobs <a href=\"http://www.policymatters.ucr.edu/pmatters-vol5-2-warehouse.pdf\">are low-paid and unsafe</a>, trapping workers in poverty with little chance of advancement, or running them ragged until they get injured.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033762\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-6749-1413418142-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-6749-1413418142-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1071\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1023px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:16\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033762','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-6749-1413418142-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Iddo Benzeevi outside the Skechers factory store and warehouse. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Jolie Myers</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the context, when, in April of last year, boosters and bashers of Benzeevi’s World Logistics Center once again hustled into the gleaming Moreno Valley City Council chambers.

But then he exploded into a tirade that made headlines.</p>\r\n<p>“I’m not gonna let these people continue to lecture us every damn council meeting on how our city sucks,” he said. “I want to make it clear for the record that these people do not speak for the citizens of the city … The people who mind their business, the people who pay their bills … maintain their jobs.”</p>\r\n<p>The mayor also said that he was “tired of the false allegations” and “the innuendo” from “smear merchants” who “degrade the people who are trying to do good.”</p>\r\n<p>One week later, the FBI and the Riverside County district attorney, working together on a “corruption task force,” <a href=\"http://www.pe.com/articles/city-668953-council-moreno.html\">raided</a> the homes of council members, along with Benzeevi’s office.</p>\r\n<p>Federal officials also subpoenaed <a href=\"http://www.moval.org/g-tran/\">tens of thousands</a> of pages of documents from the city, including all records pertaining to Benzeevi’s company, as well as other development projects.</p>\r\n<p>Six months later, in November, <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/losangeles/press-releases/2013/former-member-of-moreno-valley-city-council-agrees-to-plead-guilty-to-federal-bribery-charge-for-taking-2.3-million-cash-payment\">authorities revealed that Co had</a> been caught on tape negotiating cash payments from an undercover FBI agent and had agreed to plead guilty to taking a bribe.</p>\r\n<p>The FBI also released a photo of Co sitting in front of a table piled high with cash.

Owings issued a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312400-press-release-about-grand-jury-2.html\">press release</a> calling himself “a reform mayor” and declaring, “I welcome this probe.” He showed up uninvited at the federal grand jury to offer testimony.</p>\r\n<p>For his part, Stewart claims that his house was not really searched. He said he had begun working with the investigators about three weeks before the raids, after agents showed up at his house and told him he had once been a target but no longer was. Stewart said he thinks he stopped being a target because he had voted against Benzeevi’s wishes on a few occasions.</p>\r\n<p>“I’m not going to reveal any details of what I did with the agents, but let’s say it’s sort of like what is in the movies,” Stewart said.</p>\r\n<p>Benzeevi said he had little knowledge of the investigation but said he had been told “by both the District Attorney’s office and the Department of Justice that we are not the subject” of the investigation.</p>\r\n<p>FBI officials declined to comment. No other charges have been filed.</p>\r\n<p>Geller, the attorney who was the treasurer of the political action committee, said, “They didn’t find anything because there’s nothing to find.”</p>\r\n<p>He added, “People seem to think [the council members] would never have voted for it but for [Benzeevi’s money], but these things are all good for the city. It’s not like they are building a toxic waste site or a slaughterhouse in the middle of the city. All these people saying how terrible it is, they are people who don’t need a job.”</p>\r\n<p>Still, in the wake of the FBI raids and Co’s guilty plea, the town descended into political uproar.</p>\r\n<p>Co resigned last year, after being charged in another, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304723-marcelo-co-rif1302929-arrest-dec-redacted-1.html\">unrelated, criminal case</a> involving embezzling social service funds intended for the care of his own ailing mother.</p>\r\n<p>Mayor Owings was recalled from office in June.</p>\r\n<p>Yxstian Gutierrez, who was hastily appointed to replace Co on the city council, was recently found by a judge to not to meet residency requirements for his district and was removed from office.

The prosecution said she should have called 911.</p>\r\n<p>Collin Grant’s case illuminates what domestic violence advocates say is a different problem: the collateral damage to the children of mothers sent away to prison for years.</p>\r\n<p>“What are we really doing on behalf of that child who is the victim of the crime?” said Deborah D. Tucker, <a href=\"http://www.ncdsv.org/ncd_staff.html\">executive director</a> of the National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence. “How is that” — imprisoning the mother — “helpful to them?”</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/buzzfeed-media/Images/2014/09/buzzfeednews_failuretoprotectlaws.pdf\">At least 29 states</a> have laws that explicitly criminalize parents’ failure to protect their children from abuse. In addition, prosecutors in at least 19 states can use other, more general laws against criminal negligence in the care of a child or placing a child in a dangerous situation.</p>\r\n<p>Only a handful of state laws provide specific defenses for parents who reasonably feared they would be harmed if they stepped in to stop child abuse.</p>\r\n<p>Many prosecutors defend the laws and the harsh sentences as sending a message that mothers must defend their children, even if their own safety is at risk. Domestic violence advocates counter that such sentences are unjust — and a sign that the criminal justice system does not understand how battering victimizes women.</p>\r\n<p>Altogether, BuzzFeed News <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/these-mothers-were-sentenced-to-at-least-10-years-for-failin#34hf7pb\">found 28 cases</a> in which mothers were sentenced to at least a decade in prison despite evidence they themselves were victims of their violent partners. Alishia Mackey was one of those mothers. She was tried under Oklahoma’s “enabling child abuse” law, which has <a href=\"http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=455672\">the same maximum sentence</a> — life in prison — as actually committing child abuse.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3469656_3972975\" rel:buzz_num=\"2\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-26827-1412712786-10.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-26827-1412712786-10.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1440\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1357px; top: 432px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:2\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3469656_3972975','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-26827-1412712786-10.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Jimmy Don and Alishia <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310036-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt1.html#document/p1/a180881\">married in 1995</a>. His beatings waxed and waned — bad in the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310037-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt2.html#document/p1/a180882\">early years of their marriage</a>, for example, then <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310040-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt5.html#document/p1/a180891\">bad again</a> not long before Collin’s abuse came to light.</p>\r\n<p>Alishia <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310040-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt5.html#document/p1/a180891\">testified</a> that Jimmy Don “would punch me repeatedly, hit me with things, choke me, hold the back of — hold a gun to my head, threaten to kill me and my kids if I even told anybody” that he beat her. A former friend <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310957-former-friend-testimony.html#document/p2/a181339\">told the court</a> that Alishia had confided in her at the time that Jimmy Don was battering her. Collin <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310043-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt3.html#document/p1/a181323\">testified</a> that he saw his mom get beaten. She escaped once, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310044-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt4.html#document/p1/a180894\">he told the court</a>, but Jimmy Don “tracked us down.”</p>\r\n<p>One night, Alishia woke up <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310100-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt6.html#document/p1/a180897\">to find she was alone in bed</a>. She got up and went to her son’s bedroom. What exactly she saw is unclear. Collin <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310158-collin-testimony-excerpt8.html#document/p2/a180905\">testified</a> that Jimmy Don was molesting him, and Alishia <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310106-police-testimony-excerpt1.html#document/p1/a180900\">first told police</a> that she saw Jimmy Don on top of Collin with both of their pants down. But in court, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310100-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt6.html#document/p1/a180899\">she</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310158-collin-testimony-excerpt8.html#document/p1/a180906\">Collin</a> testified that he and Jimmy Don were both clothed.</p>\r\n<p>On the stand, Alishia changed many parts of her story and contradicted herself. “She was her own worst enemy,” David Pierce, the prosecutor, said in an interview.</p>\r\n<p>That’s not uncommon. In its investigation, BuzzFeed News found that many battered mothers lie and take other actions that make them look guilty. The terror they feel sometimes lasts even after their partner has been arrested. Then too, repeated trauma, like PTSD, can harm a person’s mental health. “There are many times when victims don’t put their best foot forward for a host of reasons — including their own sense of guilt and failure,” Tucker said.</p>\r\n<p>Alishia also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310101-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt7.html#document/p1/a180904\">testified</a> that she suffered from petit mal seizures that led her to have a faulty memory.</p>\r\n<p>At trial, prosecutors alleged that the moment when Alishia walked in on her husband and her son came two years before authorities learned of it. Police pointed to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310733-police-testimony-excerpt5.html#document/p1/a181201\">an interrogation</a> in which she allegedly said the incident happened <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310733-police-testimony-excerpt5.html#document/p3/a181202\">in January of 2002</a>, but officers <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310730-police-testimony-excerpt4.html#document/p1/a181200\">didn’t tape that interview</a>. Collin testified that it happened in the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310103-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt6.html#document/p1/a4\">fall</a> <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310735-collin-testimony-excerpt-10.html#document/p1/a181204\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310736-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt5.html#document/p2/a181208\">2003</a>, which would mean that the abuse came to light within a few months of her seeing it.</p>\r\n<p>Whatever the details, prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310739-prosecutor-opening-statement-excerpt.html#document/p1/a181210\">argued</a> that Alishia failed to protect her son by neither leaving the relationship nor going immediately to the authorities. On the stand, Collin <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310738-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt7.html#document/p1/a181209\">estimated</a> that Jimmy Don molested him “maybe” five more times after his mother first learned of the abuse and before Jimmy Don was arrested.</p>\r\n<p>Pierce, the prosecutor, declared in court that Collin wanted his mother put away. “He’d like to see her spend the rest of her life in prison,” Pierce <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310176-prosecutor-statement-excerpt.html#document/p1/a180922\">told the judge</a>. Asked about this, Collin told BuzzFeed News he was on psychotropic medication at the time of the trial and, because he was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310758-judge-agrees-to-screen-off-collin-from-his.html#document/p1/a181214\">screened off</a> from his mother during his testimony, did not realize he was testifying at her trial. He said he thought he was at his stepfather’s trial.</p>\r\n<p>One thing that Pierce never disputed was the fact that Jimmy Don had violently abused Alishia. Indeed, Pierce cited his battering of Alishia as evidence of her poor decision-making. “She made the decision to stay,” <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303314-alisha-mackey-prosecutor-opening-statement-excerpt.html#document/p1/a178175\">he told the jury</a>.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310163-alisha-mackey-jury-decision.html#document/p1/a180910\">Jurors found Alishia guilty</a> and recommended 20 years in prison. Alishia’s attorney, Corrine O’Day, protested that the prosecution had sought only 15 years when Jimmy Don pled guilty to raping Collin. “The state is not fully consistent,” <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310105-mackey-attorney-sentencing-argument-excerpt.html#document/p1/a180909\">she said</a>. But the judge <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310175-judge-determines-mackey-sentence.html#document/p1/a180920\">went with the jury’s recommendation</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Told that Collin recently said his mother should not be in prison, Pierce said, “I’m not surprised with that at all. It’s his mother.”</p>\r\n<p>But that does not change Pierce’s view on Alishia’s sentence. “I believe that that was an appropriate punishment for what she did,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>Jimmy Don’s case was handled by a different prosecutor, Sejin Brooks. Now an attorney in Austin, Texas, Brooks said “you’re absolutely right” that it might look strange that Alishia, who was convicted of permitting abuse, got a harsher punishment than Jimmy Don, who actually raped Collin. But, Brooks said, Alishia did not plead guilty but instead went to trial, risking the wrath of a judge and jury.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_narrow image_lfcn  \" id=\"superlist_3469656_3973011\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-24124-1412715170-13.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-24124-1412715170-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"720\" height=\"660\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 637px; top: 612px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3469656_3973011','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-24124-1412715170-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Visitors leave the Mabel Bassett Correctional Center in McLoud, Oklahoma. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Sue Ogrocki / AP Photo</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The courthouse would be the last place Collin saw his mother for more than five years, until he turned 18.

For his crime, Robert Braxton Jr. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p4/a186105\">served</a> two years in prison.</p>\r\n<p>In court, prosecutors presented no evidence that Hall herself had harmed the child. But for failing to intervene against Braxton’s abuse, Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186114\">was sentenced</a> to 30 years behind bars.</p>\r\n<p>Her tough sentence was meted out despite evidence that Braxton had also been violently abusing her. In statements to authorities <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186120\">in</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186121\">out</a> of court, and in a recent interview with BuzzFeed News, Hall described Braxton choking her, punching her, throwing things at her, and verbally assaulting her. Even the judge who sentenced her <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186113\">said</a> that during her testimony, Hall seemed to fear her boyfriend.</p>\r\n<p>Hall is one of 28 mothers in 11 states who a recent <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/how-the-law-turns-battered-women-into-criminals#1u8oxdk\">BuzzFeed News investigation</a> found were sentenced to 10 years or more for failing to protect their children. In <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/these-mothers-were-sentenced-to-at-least-10-years-for-failin\">every one</a> of these cases, there was evidence the mother herself had been violently abused by the man. Hall is one of three cases BuzzFeed News found in which the mother got <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/mothers-imprisonment-leads-rape-victim-to-wish-he-had-never\">a longer sentence</a> than the man who actually abused the child.</p>\r\n<p>Braxton walked free eight years ago, having been <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p4/a186105\">let go for time served</a>. Meanwhile, Hall has been locked up in an all-female prison in McLoud, Oklahoma. She said that she has seen her children only once since she went to prison but that they write each other monthly. In letters shared with BuzzFeed News, the children tell her about sports, school, and clothes. They make reference to her case, too. “I hope God Let’s [sic] you out of jail,” one letter says.</p>\r\n<p>Hall has been trying to get her sentence reduced. She currently has <a href=\"http://docapp065p.doc.state.ok.us/servlet/page?_pageid=394&amp;_dad=portal30&amp;_schema=PORTAL30&amp;doc_num=542749&amp;offender_book_id=323174\">20 years left</a> behind bars. She <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355381-hall-appeal-ruling.html\">appealed but lost</a>, and the trial judge in her case has <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355382-hall-sentence-modification-request-denial.html\">denied a request</a> to modify her sentence. She will not be eligible for parole until 2030.</p>\r\n<p>But she is pursuing one last hope: clemency. Earlier this month, Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html\">applied</a> for her sentence to be commuted — which would release her while not absolving her of her crime.</p>\r\n<p>In the wake of BuzzFeed News’ original investigation, a women’s rights organization <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/meet-the-abuse-victim-who-got-30-years-in-prison-and-the-fem\">took up Hall’s cause</a>, creating an <a href=\"http://act.weareultraviolet.org/sign/tondalo_hall/?source=uv_website\">online petition</a> to the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board. “Tondalo Hall shouldn’t be in prison while the man who abused her and her children is free,” wrote <a href=\"http://www.weareultraviolet.org/\">UltraViolet</a>, a group that claims nearly 600,000 members nationwide. On Tuesday, an UltraViolet official said that more than 44,000 people had signed the petition since it was first circulated on Nov. 6.</p>\r\n<p>In Oklahoma, a pardon or commutation cannot be granted without the approval of the state’s parole board. It is unclear when the parole board will make a decision on Hall’s case.</p>\r\n<p>Hall herself almost missed the deadline to apply for a commutation. In Oklahoma, only inmates with 20 or more years left on their sentences can apply. When she mailed her application, Hall had 20 years and five days left behind bars.</p>\r\n<p>Another Oklahoma mother, Alishia Mackey, also received a longer sentence than the abuser, and the victim, her son, <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/mothers-imprisonment-leads-rape-victim-to-wish-he-had-never\">believes she should be free</a>.

But many domestic violence advocates women counter that such punishments blame the victim and demonstrate a profound misunderstanding of what it means for women to be trapped in abusive relationships. Such women often fear alerting authorities because doing so can provoke their partners to extreme violence and because the authorities often fail to protect battered women and their children.</p>\r\n<p>Hall, who dropped out of high school in 10th grade, told BuzzFeed News that she met Braxton in either 2000 or 2001, when she would have been between 15 and 17. They soon began dating, and Braxton, who is two years older than Hall, seemed ambitious and nice — in the beginning.</p>\r\n<p>She can’t quite remember what it was that set him off the first time: “I didn’t tell him where I went, or something,” she recalled. They got into an argument, she said, and he punched her in the face.</p>\r\n<p>He apologized, she recalled, and said it wouldn’t happen again, and it didn’t, for a while at least. But then, during another argument, this time when she was pregnant, he put his hands around her throat. “He told me that my mouth was too smart,” she would later <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p55/a186122\">testify in court</a>. With her head on the seat of the blue couch in her apartment, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186120\">he choked her</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The abuse, both physical and verbal, picked up once her third child (and second with Braxton) was born in August 2004, Hall told BuzzFeed News. He isolated her from her loved ones, driving “a wedge between me and my family,” she said.</p>\r\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186121\">summed up</a> the alleged abuse in her commutation application: “Robert regularly choked me, blackened my eyes, threw objects at me and verbally assaulted me, while my children were in the home.”</p>\r\n<p>Somewhere along the way, Hall’s friend Gayla Watts-Sparger noticed changes in Hall and her children. Watts-Sparger has known Hall since kindergarten and said Hall was always goofy and outgoing. “You know how you meet somebody, and everything they say is funny?” Watts-Sparger said.</p>\r\n<p>But after Hall moved in with Braxton, Hall became “a lot quieter,” Watts-Sparger said, and Hall’s children acted strange too. Watts-Sparger recalled seeing Hall’s son, who was maybe a year old at the time, sitting upright and very still for a young child. When Braxton came by, Watts-Sparger said, the young boy would flinch.</p>\r\n<p>Reached through his Facebook account, Braxton at first said he would speak with BuzzFeed News but then did not respond to subsequent messages. After BuzzFeed News left repeated voicemails and sent a detailed letter to Braxton’s address given in court papers, a woman identifying herself as “Ms. Braxton” called and said that Robert Braxton does not live there and that she doesn’t know where he is.</p>\r\n<p>In the fall of 2004, Hall said, she noticed that her 20-month-old son’s <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p45/a186123\">leg was swollen</a>. Braxton told her he didn’t know what might have happened. The problem persisted for several days, so she brought the boy to the hospital.</p>\r\n<p>Doctors determined <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p24/a186124\">he had</a> a fractured femur and other broken bones. Suspecting child abuse, authorities checked on Hall and Braxton’s 3-month-old daughter, and found similar injuries. Both Hall and Braxton were arrested.</p>\r\n<p>Detectives at the Oklahoma City Police Department brought them both into the same interview room. Before the interrogation, Braxton <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p77/a186125\">was heard whispering to Hall</a>, “Don’t say nothing.”</p>\r\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p62/a186126\">initially told</a> the police that she had hurt their son by throwing him on the bed as they were playing — a version she later said was a lie. After Braxton admitted he had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355439-braxton-tells-detective-that-he-squeezed-his.html#document/p1/a186129\">squeezed his baby daughter too tightly</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355429-detective-lorre-freeman-testimony-at-a-court.html#document/p2/a186128\">cranked her leg</a>, detectives <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355429-detective-lorre-freeman-testimony-at-a-court.html#document/p2/a186476\">concluded</a> that he was the one who had injured both children, not her.</p>\r\n<p>Hall remained in jail, though. She <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p17/a186108\">pled guilty</a> to enabling child abuse, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. She agreed to testify against Braxton — though she <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p62/a186126\">did not receive a deal</a> from prosecutors for a reduced sentence.</p>\r\n<p>Braxton took his case to trial. Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186131\">wrote</a> in her commutation application that Braxton “repeatedly threatened me” during their initial court hearings. “For example, when Robert and I were being shuttled to and from court he would terrorize me. He would tell me that I would spend the rest of my life in prison and he would be out with our children.”</p>\r\n<p>Still, Hall agreed to testify against him. During Braxton’s trial, she was the main witness who could have seen Braxton actually harming the children. Yet Hall could not point to any specific abuse that she witnessed — because, she told BuzzFeed News, she didn’t actually see any abuse happen. In court, she also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p46/a186139\">couldn’t recall</a> the date her son began having trouble walking.</p>\r\n<p>Prosecutor Angela Marsee grew frustrated that Hall was not providing enough testimony to nail Braxton. “What do you know?” <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p51/a186136\">she asked</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p51/a186140\">replied</a> that she had once woken up to hear that her daughter was screaming. Braxton had been changing the girl’s diaper. He told her nothing was wrong and that she should go back to sleep.</p>\r\n<p>The prosecutor <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186141\">asked for more</a>. “Was there anything else that happened in your apartment that gave you reason to know that your children were in danger at the hands of this defendant?”</p>\r\n<p>“Yes, ma’am,” Hall replied. That’s when she began to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186141\">describe</a> the time that Braxton had choked her, when she was pregnant. Yet Braxton’s lawyer <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p57/a186142\">objected</a> to this line of questioning, saying it was not relevant to the child abuse charge against him. The judge sided with Braxton.</p>\r\n<p>Prosecutors, who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p24/a186144\">wanted</a> life in prison for Braxton, sensed that their case against him <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186110\">was crumbling</a>. With the trial in recess, the state and the defense worked out a deal. Braxton pled guilty but <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p11/a186106\">admitted</a> to having harmed only one child. He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303337-ok-robert-braxton-plea-statement-of-facts.html#document/p1/a178180\">said</a> he grew frustrated while changing his daughter’s diaper and then broke her bones by “using too much force and pressure for a baby.” He was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p10/a186433\">sentenced</a> to 10 years in prison — but eight of those years were suspended, and he was released for time served.</p>\r\n<p>Hall was upset with the verdict. “I didn’t feel like there was any justice for my kids,” she told BuzzFeed News.</p>\r\n<p>Someone else was also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186111\">upset</a> with the trial’s outcome: Marsee, the prosecutor. And she would lay much of the blame on Hall.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508677_4231006\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/11/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-24214-1415725003-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/11/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-24214-1415725003-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 432px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:1\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508677_4231006','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/11/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-24214-1415725003-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Tondalo Hall</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>While Hall remained in jail waiting for the court to decide her punishment, the county probation office conducted <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html\">a pre-sentence report</a>. Investigators interviewed Hall, who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186146\">declared</a> that Braxton had been abusive. They also interviewed Hall’s cousin, who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p4/a186148\">took custody of her three children</a>. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186146\">According to the report</a>, the cousin stated that Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p4/a186157\">was a good mother</a> but that Braxton was very controlling, kept Hall away from her family, and did not want the boys to be kissed or hugged because doing so would make them a “punk.”</p>\r\n<p>The report noted that Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186151\">was</a> 22 years old, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186149\">had no prior arrests</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p10/a186150\">suffered</a> from depression. The report recommended a “split sentence,” which means some time in prison and some on probation. If released to probation, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p10/a186152\">the officers said</a>, “She would be supervised as a low-level offender.” Marsee, the prosecutor in both the Braxton and Hall cases, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p22/a186109\">said in court</a> that she had no issues with any of the facts in the report.</p>\r\n<p>Hall’s sentencing hearing began <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p20\">on Dec. 20, 2006</a>, two weeks <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p13/a186153\">after</a> Braxton was released. Marsee <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p26/a186143\">called</a> for Hall to spend “a significant portion of the rest of her life” in prison. “She’s their mother,” Marsee <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p27/a186154\">told the court</a>. “She is the one person in this world who should be standing up for them,” she said, yet “they were in pain because of what she didn’t do, and she should pay for that.”</p>\r\n<p>Marsee also had another reason for recommending a long sentence: Hall, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186110\">she declared</a>, was part of the reason the case against Braxton “fell apart.”</p>\r\n<p>“He definitely should have received a more significant sentence,” Marsee <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186111\">told the court</a>, “but because of her minimizing and continuing to protect herself and protect him, that had a real impact on what we were able to do with him in the jury trial. So she should not benefit from that.”</p>\r\n<p>In response, Hall’s attorney Bill Smith pointed to the choking incident. “She was scared of Robert Braxton,” Smith <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186112\">told the court</a>. He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p28/a186155\">asked</a> that she receive the same sentence as Braxton.</p>\r\n<p>When it came time for Judge Ray Elliott to announce his decision, he <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186113\">told the courtroom</a> that he had noticed some things about Hall’s testimony. After certain questions, Hall would “make direct eye contact” with Braxton before “taking a moment or two to respond.”</p>\r\n<p>“That tells me something, based on my years of experience,” Elliott said. But this did not excuse her. “Was she scared of him? Probably,” he said. “But, again, even weighing that factor into the equation I’m of the opinion she was less than candid.” He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186114\">sentenced her</a> to 30 years in prison.</p>\r\n<p>“I was speechless,” said Hall’s friend, Watts-Sparger, when she heard the news. “All I could do was cry.”</p>\r\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355381-hall-appeal-ruling.html\">appealed</a> her sentence to a three-judge panel and lost, though a dissenting judge <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355381-hall-appeal-ruling.html#document/p5/a186127\">declared</a> that she was a “poor, pathetic young woman with three young children who was involved in an abusive relationship.” She filed another petition that asked Elliott, the trial judge, to modify her sentence<b>.</b> He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355382-hall-sentence-modification-request-denial.html\">denied it</a>, because too much time had elapsed so he no longer had jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>Elliott told BuzzFeed News that he didn’t have any recollection of the details of the case — it was too long ago for him to remember. Still, he said, “I feel very comfortable with my decision, because I take every decision seriously.”</p>\r\n<p>Smith, Hall’s attorney, also said he couldn’t remember the specifics of the case. Marsee, the prosecutor, told BuzzFeed News that she, like Hall, felt that Braxton’s prison term was far too short. “I don’t need to tell you how frustrated I was with that whole situation,” she said. “It’s very unfortunate.”</p>\r\n<p>But the fact that she was scared does not absolve her of her duty as a mother. “Her sentence is appropriate for what she allowed him to do to her children,” she said. “They lived in pain because of what she did not stop.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508677_4231518\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-22724-1415728020-13.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-22724-1415728020-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"470\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 422px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508677_4231518','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-22724-1415728020-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Now Hall awaits the result of her commutation request.</p>\r\n<p>The author of the law under which Hall was convicted serves as the interim executive director of the parole board. Jari Askins was an Oklahoma state representative in 2000 when she wrote a bill that created the crime of “enabling child abuse,” with the word “enabling” meant to drive home that a failure to act was enough to warrant prosecution.</p>\r\n<p>Her law makes Oklahoma one of at least 29 states that explicitly criminalize parents’ failure to protect their children from abuse. Prosecutors in at least 19 states can use other, more general laws, such as ones against placing a child in a dangerous situation.</p>\r\n<p>Askins, whose long career in public service includes stints as a judge and lieutenant governor, told BuzzFeed News that she is sensitive to the plight of battered women. When her law was being considered, she said, she and her fellow legislators didn’t contemplate that it might help imprison women who themselves had been victimized by their partners. As executive director, she does not vote on clemency requests. Speaking generally, not of Hall’s case, she said that being battered is a mitigating circumstance that defendants could raise at trial.</p>\r\n<p>In her application for clemency, Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p12/a186434\">wrote</a> that the opposite happened. “I believe that my testimony detailing the violence in our home was used against me,” she stated. “Rather than being protected by the State, I was prosecuted.”</p>\r\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p10/a186435\">expressed remorse</a> for not getting her children out of the home sooner: “I had a duty to protect my children and I failed.” But, she <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p12/a186156\">wrote</a>, “I was trapped in an abusive relationship and I feared that alerting authorities would provoke Robert to increase his violence.” She <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186121\">said</a> she also feared that Braxton would gain custody of her children. “My decisions, although detrimental to my family, were made out of fear rather than rationality.”</p>\r\n<p>Since she got to prison, Hall has completed her GED and taken parenting classes. She holds down a job in the laundry department. And she writes letters to her children, the youngest of whom is now 10. They write her back maybe once a month or so, she said, telling her how they’re doing and what they’re up to.</p>\r\n<p>The letters update Hall on how grades are going, when spring break is approaching, what the word perimeter means. The children talk about riding bikes and what presents Santa might bring. Some feature drawings. One has two stick figures, with the person on the left labeled “me” and the person on the right labeled “you.”</p>\r\n<p>One letter tells Hall that about some new shoes and a favorite football team, the Dallas Cowboys. It also asks her a question:</p>\r\n<p>“Why did my Father break my leg, and ribs? I love you.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3508677_4231654\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-31912-1415731246-24.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-31912-1415731246-24.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"677\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 629px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508677_4231654','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-31912-1415731246-24.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Tondalo Hall</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Email the reporter at alex.campbell@buzzfeed.com</i></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n    <p class=\"print c\"><a href=\"http://buzzfeed.com\"><b>Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t\r\n\t</div>"},

Not that it was a first—I’ve “lost” a dozen or so companies in the last 15 years of investing, out of 50-odd companies that time and money has gone into, and I’m reliably informed it’s a good ratio.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126505\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">At the same time, the returns from the ones that survived and made it big have made us, I’m told again, among the best-returning funds in the country. Which made me wonder whether we were good in any way—or just the one-eyed in the land of the blind. But more on that later.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126506\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">As always, we’d documented the demises to our investors in our funds—the Limited Partners or LPs.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<div class=\"inline-ad  ad-visible\"><iframe id=\"537516121_91c0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px;\"></iframe></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126507\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">One common reason was “too early for the market.” And the next most common was “couldn’t raise the next round because the market turned.” Anecdotally, other causes were odd ones like “promoters didn’t get along” and we also had a couple we categorised as “governance issues”—officialspeak for “we caught them with their hands in the till.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126508\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Nowhere among the reasons was that us venture capitalists were to blame. While there certainly is much blame to go around our lot—one investor I know asked a friend’s company to morph into a copy of a US startup and then blamed the entrepreneur when it imploded —I’m sure I could write a long piece just on how misguidance by investors has killed many a startup.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126509\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">But the bigger issue is simply this: The venture capital (VC) fund structure simply isn’t good for startups—especially in emerging economies like India.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126510\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Here’s why.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126511\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Most VC funds around the world follow the US model in their tenure—they’re 8+2 or less often, 10+2—which means they have eight or 10 years to identify companies, deploy funds, nurture teams, take them to exit and then return money to their LPs, with a potential extension of two years for the entire process.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\"> </span><span>It takes longer than five or eight years to grow a company to a meaningful size and big public exit in India</span><span class=\"quote-line\"> </span></span><p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126512\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Here’s how the sausage factory works: if I raised money today, I’d have three or four years to find the couple of dozen startups to put the money in and after that I’d have between five and eight years to guide, help grow and exit all of those companies.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126513\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">You can see the problem right away, can’t you?</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126514\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">No Indian firm of any stature has had any real IPO exit within five to eight years of starting up. Even our new economy giants MakeMyTrip and Naukri took more than 10 years, while JustDial took more than 16 years to exit on the market.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126515\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Look at the big stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange and make a list of those that had a meaningful IPO within eight years of starting up. Your list will be an empty one. All the giants—whether it’s a TCS or Infosys in India, or a Google in the US, took much longer than eight years to exit.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126516\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">The fact is: it simply takes longer than five or eight years to grow a company to a meaningful size and big public exit in India—and in most other parts of the world, too.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126517\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">So if you’re a fund that comes in at the start of a business and does all the hard work of finding the opportunity and promoters, helping them build their team and business, guiding them through thick and thin, and then growing them past their rivals to profitability and leadership—then you simply can’t get the benefit of staying till the end. Because you have to return the money to your LPs before you’ve made any big money really. And you will almost certainly lose out on all the appreciation that should be rightfully yours.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2><strong>So how do funds cope?</strong></h2>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126518\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">They do so with a few patently damaging behaviours—at least from the startup’s point of view.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126519\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">One, as they get closer to the 5th year of investment in you, they start trying to morph you into something that they can sell to someone else. This might mean asking you to invest in things you don’t need—like a costly and meaningless TV campaign, or a complete change of focus, or even an ill-advised merger with another portfolio company.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126520\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">The second option is the nudge out. At the six and seven year mark they will put you on the block and sell you to anyone who pays what they consider a decent price—regardless of the fact that you could reach escape velocity by yourself in a few more years and deliver a lot more in returns while retaining control, if only the investors had the ability to stay longer.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\"> </span><span>If none of these happen, the rug is pulled out from under the company and they say, sorry dude, this one didn’t make it</span><span class=\"quote-line\"> </span></span><p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126521\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">And the third, even more nefariously, is the circle jerk. A bunch of funds of roughly the same size all look at their portfolios around year 5—see a bunch of unexitable businesses and then proceed to give each others’ companies an up-round (A gives a 3x up-round to B’s investee, B gives a 3x to C’s company, and C in turn returns the favour to A’s investee.)</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126522\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Net result? The LPs of A, B and C each think they’re doing very well indeed. But the startups and their founders are now left with new masters, a higher and even more indefensible valuation—and disaster is merely postponed and potentially amplified for the poor folks being led by investors in this dance.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126523\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">The fourth choice is, of course that if none of these happen, the rug is pulled out from under the company and they say, sorry dude, this one didn’t make it, off to the dead pool you go.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126524\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">VCs may follow a 8-year rhythm—but businesses certainly don’t.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126525\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">I’ve run businesses myself and I know it takes more than 10 years to hit that critical size and stability. Sometimes 15. Sometimes even more. Ironically, if I’d taken VC funding for my own startup—I’d have been worse off today, with a huge artificial pressure to exit. I’m glad nobody was nudging me out at year 6. In return, I try not to do the same with my startups, but I confess I don’t always succeed.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2><strong>What’s the way out?</strong></h2>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126526\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">First, break the US model. Like most imported processes, it’s not right for the rest of the world. In fact, I’m not sure it’s right for the US either. Dump the eight and 10 year fund structures. There are a few evergreen or 20-year plus fund structures around. Embrace that.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126527\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Some types of LPs, like pension funds, want quick returns every eight years and hence will want to be in 8-year funds. Perhaps they could be advised that early-stage, where the best returns are, shouldn’t be their cup of tea— or perhaps they could learn to be more patient if they want the super-huge returns.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\"> </span><span>Come with a Berkshire Hathaway mentality—not a Gordon Gecko built-to-Flipkart mindset</span><span class=\"quote-line\"> </span></span><p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126528\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Some other LPs—family offices, endowments, foundations and the like—should gravitate more to the early stage but their large bite sizes get in the way. They may have billions to invest and apparent logic may decide that each investment should be $100 million or more but that’s too large for early-stage funds.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126529\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">It’s unwieldy, yes—because they have more money to deploy than most early-stage funds can manage—but long-term early-stage funds are the right match for their tenure and temperament. They should figure that a teeny bit more work on their part—to write smaller cheques—will help them participate at the steepest part of the growth curve of new businesses.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126530\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Second, look to build real businesses that grow over the long term. Come with a Berkshire Hathaway mentality—not a Gordon Gecko built-to-Flipkart mindset. Also, why exit just because the company does? In firm after firm, their values have risen much more after an IPO, so why not stay in and capture the gains for your LPs years after the company goes public? A longer tenure allows you to do that.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126531\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Third, even with all this, look to make the companies grow faster—not by putting unreachable milestones or unnecessary funding in front of them—but by helping them fill out their teams much earlier with good people.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126532\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">No good CXO tends to join a startup till its third year and second round of funding.

He keeps pulling me toward the cab and I keep resisting. Everything is falling apart, and he knows it. The hardness on his face twists into anger and then rage, almost as if it is traveling along some sort of spectrum of hatred. This happens quickly, like he has to touch every base when all he wants to do is get to the end. Then he is there and the decision is made.</p>\r\n<p>The man grabs for his gun. He needs both hands to chamber the bullet; his right holds the metal, the left works the lever. And now it is just him, waving his gun like he wants to destroy the world and press reset. For three seconds, an eternity when you’re waiting on bullets, I’m stuck in the middle. One man is about to shoot and another is pulling on my backpack. The second man drops my backpack and chambers his own bullet. Then everyone is moving at once.

Big, blank, and imaginary; it was perfect. A boy’s world of dominoed dunes and empty spaces that stretched and shimmered across the pages my mother read to me every evening in our Nebraska apartment.</p>\r\n<p>My father had just left, and I was having trouble sleeping. My baby brother didn’t seem bothered. But I was a couple years older and more easily frightened. During the day I rarely spoke or cried, but at night I couldn’t close my eyes. My mom must have been struggling too, because at some point during that ugly stretch reading became our thing. There had always been bedtime stories, but this was something different. This was a mother’s magic trick, the borrowing of alternate worlds to escape our own.</p>\r\n<p>We started with Bible stories, bearded patriarchs and long robes, before working our way through the public library’s collection of <i>The Black Stallion</i> books. I adored Alec, the redheaded hero of the series, almost as much as I loved the Black, the wild Arabian stallion at its center. The pair appealed to me because they were me, or at least the me I wanted to be. Alec was young and independent, free from parental interference, and the Black was big and loyal, just like my own horse.</p>\r\n<p>After the divorce, my mother had fixated on the animal, stubbornly refusing to sell our one luxury. Molly wasn’t black or a stallion, but my mind was already learning to skip past the awkward inconsistencies of life. I didn’t know Palomino or mare. But I knew horse. And that’s what I had. Sitting on Molly wearing a plastic cowboy hat, I spent my days playing through the stories we read at night. One minute I was Alec racing the Black through Arabia, the next I was Jedediah Smith crossing the Mojave. Already I was learning the dangers of the desert. Smith, my mother would read one night, died on the Santa Fe Trail full of Comanche arrows. Another night, Alec got trampled. Slowly, as the stories began to accumulate, tragedy seeped into play. “Sorry, Molly,” I would whisper toward the end of our sessions, “we’re lost and I have to eat you.” Patting her neck, I tried to ease the sting of my words. “It’s the only way I’ll survive.”</p>\r\n<p>As our reading times expanded, so too did my imagination. What started as a desperate attempt to get a scared little boy to sleep had grown into a ritualized treat: reading time with mom. The comfort of her voice gave way to the rhythm of the story, as I went from not knowing the shapes of letters to sounding out words. Only later, when I started to go off on my own, reading large chunks while she was away at work, did things change. For a while we had two sets of books: ours and mine. But that didn’t last either. I read too much, too fast. And as my stack of library books dwindled, I tended to steal from our shared pile. My tastes changed as well, moving out from the half-shelves around the library checkout counter to Hardy Boys mysteries and western biographies deeper in the stacks. But I never left the desert, not really.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264317\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-9483-1416066150-12.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-9483-1416066150-12.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1100\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1417px; top: 1052px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3513705_4264317','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-9483-1416066150-12.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Illustration by Sam Kalda for BuzzFeed</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>First it was Cairo, on a semester abroad program during my junior year. Then it was the Peace Corps in Jordan after graduation. That was the beginning, a decade in which I spent much of my time living in the Middle East. It was also the decade of 9/11 and a pair of massive wars.</p>\r\n<p>Cairo was exotic but crowded and Jordan’s eastern desert was drab and dreary, more volcanic rock than sand. But Yemen was different. Vibrant and stark, it felt like the underside of a rainbow. Sanaa had character and a wild, intoxicating charm. Politics, even at the top, was real and contested. Ali Abdullah Salih, a rough-talking president with a whiskey habit, had been in charge since before I was born, but even he was constrained. Tribes mattered more than parties, and alliances were always in flux. For a year, I spent my mornings reading Arab histories and my afternoons parsing rumors in sweaty little rooms where the smoke floated in layers. I was 24 years old and I was hooked.</p>\r\n<p>A trio of guards and doormen were my guides that first year. They taught me how to chew qat, rubbing and polishing the leaves, and welcomed me into their circle. We went shooting together in the desert, and opened up to each other in the awkward, fumbling manner of boys learning to become men.</p>\r\n<p>One day, Shaqib confessed this was how he imagined heaven: the four of us sitting around chewing qat, laughing and joking. “Paradise,” he told me, “is the best of this world.” And that year the best of our world took place in a cramped little guard shack with crumbling walls off al-Bawniya Street. Outside everything was a mess with horrifying pictures from Abu Ghraib and Saddam in a spider hole. But inside there was the gentle grace of centuries and the human warmth and dignity that in Yemen could transcend everything else. Politics was one thing; personal interactions were something else.</p>\r\n<p>Most evenings, after qat, I slipped off on my own for a quiet walk. I usually turned right toward Zubayri Street and my favorite bookshop, dusty and disorderly, before reversing course for Sanaa’s old city and a glass of milky tea. History lived near the surface on those walks. I passed a bombed-out palace from Yemen’s last revolution in 1962 and, a bit further on, a paved-over square where the imam used to behead dissidents with a single stroke from a sword called “The Purifier.” The palace had been converted into a secret prison, and teenagers played soccer all night in the square. But the past was still there if you knew where to look.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264376\" rel:buzz_num=\"13\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3513705_4264376\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264376\"}}' rel:description=\"For the first time I felt physically unsafe.

In late 2012, after the Arab Spring and the uprisings that forced Salih to step down, I scheduled another quick trip. I had lived through the revolution in Cairo, and had seen the expectations of change and a better life inflate and then burst leaving everyone more confused than ever. Yemen had changed as well. No one seemed to know the rules anymore. Salih was out and security was evaporating. There was a mad scramble for power that fall, and for the first time I felt physically unsafe. It was just a feeling, impossible to quantify, but I couldn’t shake it.</p>\r\n<p>Yemeni friends on Twitter and Facebook disagreed with my assessment, claiming I had lost my feel for the country. And maybe I had. What did I know about predicting violence? But I wasn’t alone. Among the small group of Yemen watchers, the numbers had started to lose their meaning with repetition: 40% chance of bombing, 60% chance of being kidnapped. They were guesses without an anchor. No one knew anything for certain. Western embassies issued travel warnings, but they were as vague as everything else. Yemen was bad — maybe not Iraq bad — but the speculation kept getting worse.</p>\r\n<p>Still, earlier this spring I decided to go back one more time. I pitched it to my editors as a three-story trip. But in my mind, it was a final farewell. I was getting married in a few months, and I wanted to move on and write about other things. I’d quit smoking years earlier and my twenties had slipped into my thirties. I was ready for a change. On March 6, I boarded the plane for my last trip to Yemen.</p>\r\n<p>Sixteen days later I was done. I had my three stories, or at least the notes and interviews to write them. But I didn’t want to leave, not yet. Something was still missing. Instead of flying home early, I compromised: One more story.</p>\r\n<p>I already knew the one I’d do. The ghost story every writer has, the one they obsess over and worry about; always researching, never writing. Mine was a tragedy that started with a Guantanamo interrogation.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Detainee: I am from Urday City in Yemen, not a city in al-Qaeda… My city is very far from the city of al-Qaeda… That is not my name and I am not from that city…</p>\r\n<p>Tribunal President: al-Qaeda is not a city. It is the name of an organization.</p>\r\n<p>Detainee: Whether it is a city or an organization, I am not from al-Qaeda. I am from Urday City.</p>\r\n<p>Tribunal President: Are you from Yemen?</p>\r\n<p>Detainee: Yes, I am from Urday.</p>\r\n<p>Tribunal President: Did you travel from Yemen to Afghanistan?</p>\r\n<p>Detainee: I went from Yemen to Afghanistan.</p>\r\n<p>Tribunal President: Did you do that in the year 2000?</p>\r\n<p>Detainee: I don’t know the time.</p>\r\n<p>Tribunal President: Was it the year 1421?</p>\r\n<p>Detainee: I am from a village, I cannot tell time.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The detainee, Adnan Abd al-Latif, was a mentally unstable man who had suffered severe brain damage as a result of a car crash in 1994. Twice he had been cleared for release, but each time something went wrong and he remained locked in his cell, counting the days until there was nothing left to count. On Sept. 10, 2012, he committed suicide. He had been in Guantanamo Bay for more than a decade.</p>\r\n<p>Latif’s case seemed to get at all the horrors of that lost decade: a handicapped man who confused al-Qaeda with a Yemeni village of the same name, locked up as the worst of the worst. For 10 years, while Latif befriended the iguanas and banana rats that wandered into his cell, the U.S. and Yemen fought for custody. Neither side would give in. The U.S. had him but wouldn’t let him go; Yemen wanted him but couldn’t get him.</p>\r\n<p>Then Latif killed himself with a fistful of pills and positions changed. Now neither country wanted him. The U.S. needed him gone, but Yemen wouldn’t take him. In death, just as in life, he was in legal limbo — neither here nor there. Instead of Guantanamo, Latif was sent to Germany, where his body was frozen and stored at Ramstein Air Base while the two countries argued over who had to take the corpse.</p>\r\n<p>Latif’s story was sad, but mostly it was just human. He wasn’t nameless or faceless, an abstract stand-in for our fears. He was a man with a history and a family, and I wanted to write about them, to tell his story. In my mind it was less about Guantanamo Bay than it was about the withering of hope and how a single man had been ground down to nothing by a pair of bureaucracies. But no one else seemed to see it this way. Obama had already ordered the prison closed. He just hadn’t succeeded. Guantanamo was still open, and indefinite detention was still the law of the land. But the country had moved on; a collective forgetting that let us pretend everything had changed when nothing had.</p>\r\n<p>Before I left the U.S. I had reached out to one of the Guantanamo lawyers and he gave me the name of Latif’s brother in Yemen. Muhammad lived in Taizz, four hours south of Sanaa. But Yemen was still coming apart, and the roads were too dangerous for a drive. I asked Muhammed if he would fly to Sanaa for an interview.</p>\r\n<p>Since arriving in Sanaa I had been working with Shuaib, a young fixer and friend, who knew how to get things done in a country where nothing worked. That morning I met him at the ticket office to buy Muhammad’s plane ticket. The money I had just collected from Western Union went from me to Shuaib to the man behind the counter. I signed the receipt, the man behind the counter stamped it, and Shuaib called Taizz to confirm that Muhammad was on his way to the airport. It was just after 9:30 a.m. on Saturday, March 22. Muhammad’s flight landed in three hours, and Shuaib wanted breakfast.</p>\r\n<p>When we arrived at the ticket office, Zubayri Street had been quiet. In another hour the shadows would be gone and the street would be noisy and hot with four jumbled lanes of traffic. But for the moment it was neither. Caught between the two, Zubayri Street came to life in fits and starts. Shuaib moved through it quickly, claiming he could smell something good. I smelled diesel and cigarettes. After a block whatever scent he was tracking had disappeared, and he gave up.</p>\r\n<p>“Let’s just go in here,” he said. The restaurant looked like every other one on the street: an open front with a roll-up shutter, a counter in the front, kitchen in the back, and long metal tables in between. “Sure,” I said. But I didn’t really care. I’d already had breakfast; I just wanted another cup of coffee. “This is fine.”</p>\r\n<p>Stepping up onto the sidewalk, Shuaib bumped into a soldier who was coming out of the restaurant, catching his windbreaker on the man’s rifle. “Sorry,” he mumbled, as he reached over to untangle his jacket. The man just looked at him, taking in Shuaib’s youth and his slight frame. And then he saw me. I was used to it, the attention and the double takes. Yemenis tend to stare at obvious foreigners, observing them as if they were under glass. But this time the lack of words was disconcerting. We were in the man’s space, inches from his face with Shuaib’s jacket hooked on his rifle. The whole thing was too intimate for silence. But the man in the olive green uniform didn’t say a word. Only his eyes moved, following Shuaib’s fingers as they slid up the barrel of his gun. Then we were free and moving again.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_right_small   \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264382\" rel:buzz_num=\"14\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3513705_4264382\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264382\"}}' rel:description=\"It was nothing and he was no one, a soldier with a gun in a country that had plenty of both.\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:14\"></a>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-twitter-share fa fa-twitter\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"twitter3513705_4264382\" rel:via=\"gregorydjohnsen\" rel:sub_title=\"It%20was%20nothing%20and%20he%20was%20no%20one,%20a%20soldier%20with%20a%\" rel:adtl_tweet_text=\" \" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"tw-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264382\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/list-item:14\"></a>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3513705_4264382\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264382\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:14\" rel:count=\"4\"></a>\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\t<blockquote class=\"white_pullquote\" style=\"font-family: 'Bitter'; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.1em; font-size: 36px; color: #004F9E; background-color: #FFFFFF; \">It was nothing and he was no one, a soldier with a gun in a country that had plenty of both.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>That was it, a few seconds on the street before breakfast. It was nothing and he was no one, a soldier with a gun in a country that had plenty of both. We were already past it. He wasn’t.</p>\r\n<p>Fifteen minutes later, the man was waiting for us. I saw him as soon as we left the restaurant: Ten yards up the road next to another man in a military uniform. Both of them were young, and both had guns.</p>\r\n<p>The first man, the one Shuaib had bumped into, crossed the space between us surprisingly quickly and grabbed his arm. “Who is this?” he asked in rough Arabic, with a gesture toward me.</p>\r\n<p>“He’s my friend,” Shuaib replied.</p>\r\n<p>“Is he a foreigner?”</p>\r\n<p>“Yeah,” Shuaib said. “He’s an American researcher.”</p>\r\n<p>“OK,” the man said, pulling Shuaib toward the street. “Come to the base with us.

Get in the car and you’re kidnapped, resist and you’re dead. Months earlier a German diplomat had been caught in a similar situation. He resisted, breaking free of his Yemeni kidnappers in a Sanaa supermarket. He lasted only a few terrifying seconds. The kidnappers caught back up to him and, in the middle of a grocery store aisle, they executed him.</p>\r\n<p>Back in the U.S., talking through my options with Asha, the woman I would marry, I had been uncertain. I told her what to do — who to call and what to say if I were taken. But I hadn’t been able to decide on my own course of action: submit or resist. Each had benefits, each had drawbacks; neither was good. Yet when the moment came, my body didn’t give me a choice.

In my heart or out loud, in Arabic or English, I don’t know. But I said it: “There’s no way I’m getting into that cab.” Then I jerked my arm back. The man pulled harder, and we were scuffling. There was no punching or screaming, none of the things I would have imagined, just a weird one-armed tug-of-war over a few yards of asphalt. I was older and stronger, but he had a gun. His hand, dry and cracked, slipped down past my wrist, catching on the backpack that I had slung over one arm. For a second, I thought about dropping the backpack and running. But it had the rest of the $600 I’d pulled out of Western Union, my passport, and all my notebooks from two weeks of work. I tugged.</p>\r\n<p>Several Yemenis had gathered around us in a loose half-circle. I had always assumed that if something went really wrong, some Yemeni would step up to save me. That had been my insurance policy as I moved through a society that was not my own. But now I was being taken and they were just watching.</p>\r\n<p>In our world, evil typically wears a mask. It stalks about in disguise, peeking out through the cracks in our humanity. We rarely see it or recognize it when we do, but on that morning in Sanaa it was unmistakable. Dropping Shuaib’s arm, the man grabbed for his gun. That’s when I thought he would start shooting. Shuaib moved fast, escaping up the street and scrambling for cover. The second man let go of my backpack to chamber his own bullet, and then I was running too.</p>\r\n<p>I remembered to zigzag as I ducked into a different restaurant and headed for the back. My plan was to run through the kitchen and escape out the back and then make a big loop back to the American Institute, where I was staying. I made it to the rear of the restaurant, but as I tried to go through the kitchen, one of the Yemeni workers blocked me.</p>\r\n<p><i>“Mamnu‘a,”</i> he said.</p>\r\n<p>“Forbidden,” I panted back dumbly. He just stared at me and said <i>mamnu‘a</i> a second time.</p>\r\n<p>I was trapped. The restaurant was laid out like a giant L, one long main room with a right-angled nook for a sink. I was around the corner by the sink, only a few feet from the door to the kitchen and the way out. But I could no longer see the street and I started to panic. I had to move, to get out of the restaurant. Any second, the men were going to come around the corner. In my mind, I saw the German diplomat lying dead on the grocery store tile.</p>\r\n<p>I tried to get through the kitchen door a second time, but another employee wrapped me in a giant bear hug and said <i>mamnu‘a</i> yet again. I had no more moves. There was nothing left to react against. Shaking as fear crashed over adrenaline, I tried to think. I needed a plan and I didn’t have one.</p>\r\n<p>Fumbling with my backpack, I found my phone and called a contact at the U.S. Embassy. Earlier that week I’d met him for lunch, seen his guard detail, and ridden in the armored SUV. Maybe he could come to the restaurant and escort me out. But no one picked up. I dialed a second number; still nothing.</p>\r\n<p>Waiters were still moving back and forth with food and people were eating. But I was stuck, cowering in a corner waiting for whatever came next. A couple of Yemenis came over to tell me that the men were gone, but I didn’t believe them. Then, someone walked over with a metal cup of water in his hand.</p>\r\n<p>“Don’t worry,” he told me. “You’re under my protection.</p>\r\n<p>I wanted to laugh. He had a cup; the men outside had guns. I explained that they were trying to kidnap me.</p>\r\n<p>“You’re a foreigner?” he asked. “Syrian?”</p>\r\n<p>“No,” I said. “I’m American.”</p>\r\n<p>“Hmm,” he shrugged, and walked away. After that, no one else approached me.</p>\r\n<p>A few minutes later, Shuaib came around the corner. “They’re gone,” he said. But my heart was still pounding, and I no longer trusted Yemen or my instincts. I didn’t move. The corner had become safe.</p>\r\n<p>Shuaib left and came back. “They’re really gone.”</p>\r\n<p>“OK,” I said. “Let’s go.”</p>\r\n<p>We grabbed a cab in front of the Chinese Embassy, while Shuaib called the police and I gave the driver directions. “Those weren’t real soldiers,” Shuaib told me with the phone pressed up against his ear. I held my bag as he told the driver to go the wrong way up a one-way street. Two minutes later we were in front of the American Institute.</p>\r\n<p>“Stay inside,” Shuaib implored. “Don’t go out.”</p>\r\n<p>I called the embassy and reported the incident. I told the director and I emailed Asha. Then the electricity went out and there were no more distractions. I imagined Shuaib hit in the head and dumped out of the car. I would be taken to some house for a few days and then smuggled past the checkpoints around Sanaa. After that I’d be gone. It had happened before, and it would happen again. Sitting alone in my room on a sunny Saturday morning in Sanaa, I felt my fear grow wild and unchained like a beast come back to life. It was the fear of a little boy who didn’t understand the world or what was happening around him.</p>\r\n<p>Getting out of the room suddenly seemed very important. I wasn’t hungry, but it was lunchtime. Time to go. I paused in the courtyard, taking in the walls that kept the rest of Yemen out. They were mud-brick and thick, comforting but debilitating. If I didn’t go now, I never would. I thought about Molly and my mother’s voice trying to make me tough for the world to come. “Get back on,” she’d say each time I got bucked off. There were no hugs or comfort in those moments, just the cold insistence of a woman who knew how hard life could be. I walked out the door.</p>\r\n<p>On the surface, the city looked the same, drab beige buildings and the crowded market where I had bought my qat a decade earlier, but it was no longer a place I knew. The bookstore on Zubayri Street was gone, swallowed up by time, and the country was changing as well. The familiar had become foreign. What thrilled me in my twenties frightened me in my thirties. I played with my food until someone asked if I was an American.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264324\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2706-1416066389-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2706-1416066389-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"176\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 128px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3513705_4264324','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2706-1416066389-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Muhammad wouldn’t come in when I opened the institute gate for him and Shuaib later that afternoon. He just stared at me for a moment, and then he said what he’d flown to Sanaa to say: “I’m here to kidnap you and sell you to al-Qaeda for $5,000, because you are an enemy of Yemen. Then al-Qaeda will torture you for 12 years and kill you and call it a suicide.”</p>\r\n<p>He had a bag and for a brief, terrifying moment I thought he had a gun. Then I thought I’d misheard. But when Shuaib translated the words were the same.</p>\r\n<p>I lost it. Kidnap me? In my own house? “How dare you come in here and say that?” I screamed. “I bought your damn ticket.” All the morning’s fear was coming out as rage.</p>\r\n<p>Muhammad just sat there silently seething as I screamed at him in Arabic before I started to stumble and switched back to English. Eventually I realized that he was just trying to make a rhetorical point, showing me what had happened to his brother and how he ended up in Guantanamo, but by then I was too far gone to care. It felt good to unload on him, to scream and rant and finally react to the morning. In that moment, I hated him and his country. He was mad about what happened to his brother, and I was mad about what happened to me. But I wasn’t the one who had forced his brother into suicide, and he wasn’t the one who had tried to kidnap me. We were just stand-ins.</p>\r\n<p>Later — I couldn’t handle speaking directly to him — I asked Shuaib to apologize and explain what had happened to us that morning. Muhammad just shrugged. He didn’t care. Probably no more than I really cared about his brother’s experience. Our own pain was what was personal and real, everything else was just a story.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264359\" rel:buzz_num=\"11\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/11/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-22875-1416067316-17.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/11/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-22875-1416067316-17.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"196\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 148px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:11\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3513705_4264359','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/11/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-22875-1416067316-17.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A week or so after I got back, I reached out to a Yemeni contact. I was finishing up my first story and I needed an interview. I’d already talked to his dad and brother on my trip, but it turned out that he had more information than anyone else and that he lived in Brooklyn. I suggested dinner at the Yemen Café on Atlantic.</p>\r\n<p>I got there early and for a few minutes I just sat and listened to the chatter around me. English and Arabic, familiar and foreign, Brooklyn and Yemen. Everything was so mixed up and messy. The restaurant was different but the same. I couldn’t separate any of it.</p>\r\n<p>When I looked up Fahd was coming through the door with two other Yemenis. He hadn’t mentioned friends, but I didn’t want to seem like a jerk so I told them to sit down. BuzzFeed would cover the meal. They wanted to hear about my trip and what I thought of Yemen. “It’s bad,” I said. “It’s very, very bad.” They just nodded at what they already knew and ordered for me.</p>\r\n<p>The restaurant was too crowded and noisy for an interview, and one of the men suggested we talk across the street in his shop. The bill had already been paid. But as soon as he pulled down the metal shutters blocking out the light and traffic from Atlantic, I knew it was a mistake. I was in Brooklyn, seven blocks from my apartment, but my body was back in Yemen, locked in a dark room with three Yemeni men. On the audio recording of the interview my voice sounds calm. I make a joke and everyone laughs, but I could feel the truth inside: jittery, full of fear, and looking for a way out.</p>\r\n<p>For a moment I wondered if I was going mad, then I thought about PTSD. Is that why I was shaking?</p>\r\n<p>Outside, Brooklyn was chilly and calm, American. I walked Fahd and his friends to the corner and thanked them for dinner. They had been gracious and hospitable, Yemeni. Three distant echoes of the country I once knew.</p>\r\n<p>I didn’t sleep much that night. For a while I tried to read, but stories had lost their magic. There were no other worlds, only this one. And in it I did the only thing I could. I cried, facedown and helpless, on a pillow where no one could hear.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4267370\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t<h2>Sign up for our BuzzReads email, and you’ll get our best feature stories every Sunday — plus other great stories from around the web!</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n <div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n  \r\n   \r\n     <p>\r\n</p>\r\n<form rel:gt_cat=\"[ttp]:content\" action=\"http://buzzfeed.createsend.com/t/t/s/jiuhhh/\" method=\"post\">\r\n<input rel:gt_act=\"input\" id=\"fieldEmail\" name=\"cm-jiuhhh-jiuhhh\" type=\"text\" style=\"font-size:12pt; height:24px; width: 75%\" placeholder=\" your email address\" required=\"\">\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<input rel:gt_act=\"sign-up\" type=\"submit\" class=\"button2\" value=\"Sign Me Up!\" name=\"submitNewsletter\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"0\">\r\n</p>\r\n</form>\r\n   \r\n  \r\n </div>\r\n\r\n <p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://embed.contagiousmedia.com/embed/sub/sign-up-for-our-buzzreads-email-and-youll-ge-nf4usc-e4xq?uri=sign-up-for-our-buzzreads-email-and-youll-ge-nf4usc-e4xq&amp;cb=1416231318\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this embed ›</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n<hr>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n    \r\n    <p class=\"print c\"><a href=\"http://buzzfeed.com\"><b>Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\t\r\n\t</div>"},

The story, she wrote to BuzzFeed News, “dumbfounded” her: It mentioned former students facing mountains of debt for their degrees, but that didn’t seem to apply to her. Brown believed that she was “on a 100% Pell Grant through the government” and didn’t owe a cent.</p>\r\n<p>Everest even paid for her books and her laptop, she wrote, and sent her a stipend check every semester. “Will I have to pay this back or am I one of the few students being treated genuinely by Everest University?” she asked.</p>\r\n<p>In reality, most of what Brown believed to be a Pell Grant was actually loans: A review of documents she provided showed she owes more than $26,000.</p>\r\n<p>Brown, 29, who lives in Kentucky and enrolled at Everest in 2011, has yet to learn that she is going into debt for her degree. (Her last name has been changed because she is a current student.) She no longer has a phone because she is unable to pay the bills, and she sent her student loan documents from a computer at a nearby food bank where she accesses the internet. She has since been hospitalized, unreachable by phone or email.</p>\r\n<p>Like thousands of other students, Brown has fallen victim to a predatory lender that exploits the aspirations of the poor and disadvantaged. She had good reason to trust Everest Colleges and Universities and its representatives: It is a nationally accredited college, plugged into the government-backed student loan system that pays for the education of millions of students each year. But for thousands of desperate and financially unsophisticated students at Everest, that trust was deeply misplaced.</p>\r\n<p>Corinthian Colleges, Everest’s publicly traded parent company, is facing a slew of lawsuits and investigations alleging it falsified job records and misrepresented itself to students. The company is effectively being shut down by the federal government; by early next year, it will no longer own any colleges.</p>\r\n<p>Since July, I have heard from more than 150 current and former students who reached out to me through email, phone, text message, and Facebook after <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/this-new-lawsuit-against-everest-college-explains-why-the-go\">a story about Everest I wrote in April</a> began circulating widely among former students. The vast majority I spoke to were poor women, many of them minorities, who said they were lured to enroll with promises of jobs and good wages that would support their families. They told me they had taken out tens of thousands of dollars in loans, often without understanding the extent of their debt, and sometimes not even knowing they were in debt at all. The tactics that admissions officers had used to convince them to enroll, they said, were manipulative and unethical; lawsuits <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p3/a186974\">allege they were illegal</a>.</p>\r\n<p>By the end of their programs, students owed as much as $50,000, and few believe they will ever be able to repay even a fraction of it. Most said they graduated without jobs, then returned to unemployment or low-paying work in fast-food or retail. They used words like “betrayed,” “lied to,” and “victimized.” Many begged for help.</p>\r\n<p>Corinthian, Everest’s parent company, has routinely denied most of the allegations in the many lawsuits against the company. Its spokesperson, Kent Jenkins, said that Corinthian has found employment for the “vast majority” of its tens of thousands of graduates, and that the school regularly provided students with “clear and accurate” information about the cost of their educations and the ability of credits to transfer. He denied that admissions representatives used aggressive or unethical tactics to coerce students into enrolling. Corinthian’s accreditation and job placement standards, he said, are far more stringent than those at community colleges offering similar programs.</p>\r\n<p>Corinthian is being sued by the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357655-cfpb-complaint-2014.html\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> and attorneys general in <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357649-californiacomplaint2013-2.html\">California</a>, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/\">Massachusetts</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357657-wisconsin-complaint-2014.html\">Wisconsin</a>, and faces investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and six more states, as well as a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-corinthian-colleges-20140814-story.html\">criminal probe in California</a>. Earlier this year, the Department of Education reached an <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/the-government-is-finally-forcing-a-major-for-profit-college\">unprecedented agreement</a> to essentially shut down Corinthian, which was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.</p>\r\n<p>But for more than half a million current and former students, neither the shutdown nor the many lawsuits really matter. They will likely see little to no debt relief on their federal loans. They will see none of the jobs they believe they were promised. And while the company may be closing its doors, 85 of Everest’s campuses aren’t: They will be sold off, likely to other for-profit college operators or to private equity investors, and will continue to recruit and enroll students.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3509316_4254424\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr02/longform-12023-1415917767-31.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr02/longform-12023-1415917767-31.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"386\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 338px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4254424','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr02/longform-12023-1415917767-31.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">The administration office entrance at Everest College in Santa Ana, California. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Don Bartletti/Los Angeles Times / MCT</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At every step of the way, people fell prey to Everest precisely because of tactics designed to capitalize on their poverty and their trust in an accredited university.

In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bbFmZIdlBw\">one</a>, a young black man standing in a dark parking lot commands: “You’re sitting on the couch, watching TV, and your life’s passing you by … You spend all day on the phone anyhow, why don’t you make a phone call that’s gonna help you in your future?” He adds, shaking his head dismissively, “It’s <i>easy</i>.” Another features a woman standing on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12YQy0suTP4\">a freeway overpass</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_video video_youtube buzz_superlist_item_narrow video_hit no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3509316_4252305\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content c\">\r\n\t\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"video-embed-big video-embed-area bf_dom\" id=\"video_buzz_element_3509316_4252305\" rel:thumb=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/12YQy0suTP4/2.jpg\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"video\" : {\"size\": \"big\", \"width\":\"625\", \"height\":\"376\", \"url\":\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=12YQy0suTP4\", \"id\":\"3509316_4252305\"}}'><embed id=\"embed_3509316_4252305\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/12YQy0suTP4?version=3&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;playerapiid=embed_3509316_4252305&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"625\" height=\"376\" bgcolor=\"#000\" wmode=\"opaque\" class=\"ytvideo\"></embed></div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The minute those who see Everest’s commercials make that phone call, they are met with a fine-tuned sales machine intended to get them to enroll as quickly as possible. Students spoke of receiving phone calls daily, even four or five times a day. The calls didn’t end until they agreed to speak at length with an admissions representative, by phone or on campus.</p>\r\n<p>Everest’s admissions representatives are salespeople — the jobs are advertised as such by Corinthian, according to the California lawsuit. What they sell, though, is something much bigger than a college education, or even the promises of job placement services and $12 hourly salaries. They sell prospective students a future that many of them never imagined was possible.</p>\r\n<p>Students told me they felt they had no choice but to enroll. Not to do so, they said, seemed like turning down a guarantee at a better life for themselves and their families. “They put on a great act saying how many jobs were available and how good I was gonna get paid,” Cacha Cherry, who graduated from Everest in 2010, wrote in an email about the first day she visited an Everest campus. “They told me about people who had gotten a job and had wonderful careers and great lives — how they were able to buy homes, go on vacations, and live this wonderful life.”</p>\r\n<p>Cherry had no intention of enrolling that day, but the representatives prepared papers for her to sign, despite her protests. “I felt pressured to sign because I wanted to make a good living for my child — I was a young mother trying to make a better life for both of us.”</p>\r\n<p>A former admissions representative at Everest, one of five with whom I communicated, said Everest taught a sales tactic her supervisors called “peeling the onion,” appealing to students’ emotions by asking them leading questions that focused on their hopes and dreams. “We’d say, ‘How do you think this degree will change your daughter’s life?’ or ‘How meaningful would being the first person in your family to graduate from college be?’ It was all about the emotional side.” She called the enrollment tactics she was taught “beyond deceptive and immoral, given the circumstances of the prospective students.”</p>\r\n<p>Everest’s admissions representatives were under heavy pressure to sign up students — <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1358002-2013-10k-2.html#document/p30/a186771\">until recently, they were paid based</a> in large part on how many students they enrolled, a practice that was made legal under a series of “safe harbor” laws passed by the Bush administration in 2002. Those rules were repealed by the Obama administration in 2011, but four former admissions representatives told me that their job performance was evaluated based in part on enrollment numbers.</p>\r\n<p>“We had to hit certain enrollment numbers or risk our jobs,” said another former admissions representative, who asked not to be named because his current employer is also a for-profit college. “So plenty of students were enrolled that weren’t supposed to be.”</p>\r\n<p>Jenkins denied this. Company-wide evaluation standards, the company spokesperson said, “do not include the number of students [admissions representatives] enroll.”</p>\r\n<p>Former students said Everest’s admissions office also used tactics more akin to those found in high-pressure sales environments. Many students who visited Everest’s campus for tours or simply to pick up brochures said they found themselves ushered into the enrollment and financial aid offices, bombarded by promises about job placement and encouraged to make a choice to better their futures. To get them to enroll immediately, Everest representatives often told students that they risked losing their spot in the school or that the semester was about to begin without them,” suggesting they may have to wait months or even a year before the next chance to enroll</p>\r\n<p>“It was considered a failure if we didn’t enroll by the end of the day” of their first visit, said the former admissions representative. Two other former admissions officers made similar assertions. If students seemed hesitant to enroll on their first visit, one representative said, administrators “would meet with them personally” before they left campus.</p>\r\n<p>Students said that as a result of the rushed, single-day process, they were given little time to read the documents they were signing. They instead trusted the word of the admissions representative who explained the documents.</p>\r\n<p>“I remember feeling extremely overwhelmed and confused about what was happening, and by the end of the conversation, I’d basically signed up for the school and was beginning classes,” said LaShayna Bell, of Tempe, Arizona, who enrolled in 2010. “It was like I blinked and missed what I’d done.”</p>\r\n<p>Jenkins said that it is “extremely rare” for a student to enroll on the first visit, but would not specify whether that included signing preliminary paperwork. “We encourage students to take their time and consider it carefully,” Jenkins said. “We encourage prospective students to bring a family member or close friend on the first visit, and to ask questions about all aspects of the program.”</p>\r\n<p>That family member, however, sometimes turned into another opportunity for the company. Interviews with admissions representatives and former students show that Everest’s tactics were so aggressive that the school sometimes also enrolled the mothers, sisters, and spouses who accompanied prospective students on campus visits.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4254607\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-15345-1415918869-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-15345-1415918869-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"835\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 787px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4254607','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-15345-1415918869-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Molly Hensley-Clancy for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The vast majority of Everest’s students have no prior experience with college — few relatives who attended themselves or high school counselors to help navigate the process. Sintia Lopez, a veteran, emigrated from Nicaragua when she was 12, unable to speak a word of English; she knew nobody who had ever gone to college. She believed her Everest representative when she was told that the school was one of the best in Florida, and believed the representative’s claim that the high tuition was a sign of quality education that she wouldn’t get at a community college. She didn’t know that it was abnormal for a school to call you at all hours of the day, begging you to enroll.</p>\r\n<p>Admissions representatives enrolled many students who were unlikely, or even unable, to succeed in college: Among those I spoke with, more than a dozen did not have a GED, including an eighth-grade dropout who was enrolled in an accounting program. Several were violent felons who could not legally be employed in the health care industry or criminal justice jobs offered by their programs.</p>\r\n<p>Many more appeared to be only semi-literate and were unprepared to handle college-level work. One student, who had completed a medical assistant program months after being released from jail on a felony assault charge, wrote to me: “I need getting loans with cleared cause I had just got out of prison and I dont a ged and they promised they would get me a job my name [redacted] please help me.” She asked not to be named because of her felony.</p>\r\n<p>At Everest’s Milwaukee outpost, according to allegations in the Wisconsin attorney general’s lawsuit, the campus president insisted on turning away students with criminal records who wanted to enroll in health care programs because they could not be employed in the fields they were training for. When the president left, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357657-wisconsin-complaint-2014.html#document/p9/a186623\">the suit alleges</a>, the school not only ceased using background checks, it called back those students with criminal records who had been turned away and tried to enroll them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_narrow image_lfcn  \" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255025\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-mid-21160-1415922102-1.png\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-mid-21160-1415922102-1.png\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"720\" height=\"396\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 637px; top: 348px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255025','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-mid-21160-1415922102-1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">A promotional mailing sent to prospective students, which was included in the complaint by Wisconsin’s attorney general. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Wisconsin Attorney General / Via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/complaint-corinthian-colleges-20141027.pdf\">wordpress.com</a></span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Everest voluntarily closed the Wisconsin campus two years after its opening, acknowledging it had problems. At the urging of regulators, the company agreed to issue refunds to students who had not graduated. (Those with diplomas, regardless of whether they’d found employment, received no money.) Jenkins said the fact that the company had ultimately shut down the Wisconsin campus was evidence that Corinthian was committed to addressing wrongdoing.</p>\r\n<p>“It is not in our interest to enroll students who can not successfully complete their courses, and we have policies that are based on that understanding,” Jenkins said.</p>\r\n<p>In 2009, according to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1358001-2009-10kl-2.html#document/p12/a186738\">regulatory filings</a>, 23% of Corinthian students did not have high school diplomas or GEDs. The company stopped enrolling students without diplomas in 2010, after the government no longer allowed them to receive federal financial aid.</p>\r\n<p>The first former admissions representative spoke of enrolling many students who had such limited English proficiency that she believed them unable to complete their courses, such as a mother and daughter she enrolled in a massage therapy course — which requires learning anatomy and physiology — who “could not carry on a basic conversation” in English. Her boss, the admissions representative said, told her to “put them through anyway” and ensure they sat in the class for at least five days, enough time for the school to collect their government funding. The mother and daughter did not make it through the semester.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255181\" rel:buzz_num=\"10\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-17122-1415923517-18.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-17122-1415923517-18.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1064\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1016px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:10\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255181','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-17122-1415923517-18.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Molly Hensley-Clancy for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Five months ago, Lisa Roberts enrolled at the Everest University campus a few blocks away from her Lakeland, Florida, home for one reason: She needed a job, desperately. Everest told her she was very likely to get one paying $14 an hour in her field of study, medical assisting — a nine-month certificate degree program for which she would pay $16,400. “It’s money I can’t really afford,” Roberts told me. “But I feel like this is the only thing I got.”</p>\r\n<p>Roberts, her husband, and their three elementary school–aged children live on the $8-an-hour salary her husband makes as a laborer in a nearby salvage yard, renting a small, sparsely furnished home from her husband’s boss. (Her name was changed because she is a current student.) Roberts’ son, who is on the autism spectrum, is homeschooled because of his frequent and sometimes violent outbursts, and she is counting on a night job at a hospital so she can stay home with him. Her 11-year-old niece moved in with the family in September.</p>\r\n<p>If she doesn’t get a job, Roberts said, “I honestly don’t know what I’ll do. We’re counting on this for a lot of reasons. We’re completely counting on it.”</p>\r\n<p>But Roberts is already worried. In her last two months at Everest, she has had seven teachers for a single medical assistant course. She tallies them off on her fingers: Most quit, one saying she’d never been paid, several moved, others disappeared with no explanation. “We show up and they’re gone,” she said. Instead of normal good-byes at the end of class, she said, students say to teachers, “Hope we see you tomorrow!”</p>\r\n<p>Allegations in the many lawsuits against Corinthian Colleges paint a grim picture of the likelihood that Roberts will get the medical assistant job she says she was promised.</p>\r\n<p>To encourage students to enroll, Corinthian routinely <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p27/a186739\">told prospective students</a> that they had job placement rates of 70%, often as high as 90%. But those were “substantially and materially false,” according to allegations in the Massachusetts lawsuit: In <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p27/a186740\">one example</a>, a 72% placement rate was in fact 23%.</p>\r\n<p>In its lawsuit, the California attorney general’s office alleges that just a tiny fraction of the jobs Everest claimed it had placed students in, often around 30%, could be <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357649-californiacomplaint2013-2.html#document/p13/a186748\">fully verified</a>. Most job placement records were “missing,” and for those records that could be found, the company routinely counted short-term positions as “careers” or included jobs that students were working outside of the fields they had trained for. One example <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p29/a186749\">cited in the suit</a> were dozens of students whose “careers” consisted of placements at health-screening fairs that lasted just two days.</p>\r\n<p>“In some cases,” <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357649-californiacomplaint2013-2.html#document/p10/a186746\">the California suit reads,</a> “there is no evidence that a single student in a program obtained a job during the time frame specified.”</p>\r\n<p>Allegations about falsified and misleading job placement rates are also at the center of the federal lawsuit, as well as suits in Wisconsin and Massachusetts and investigations in six other states. The lawsuit in Wisconsin alleges that in 2011, the actual job placement rate at Everest’s Milwaukee campus, which the company voluntarily shut down in 2012, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357657-wisconsin-complaint-2014.html#document/p14/a3\">was 5.5%</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Corinthian <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357170-cci-response-to-ma-attorney-general-lawsuit.html\">strongly disputes</a> these allegations, saying that the “vast majority” of Everest’s graduates find a job in their field. The company argues that the standards used to verify jobs in the Massachusetts suit, requiring job placements to be long-term, are <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357170-cci-response-to-ma-attorney-general-lawsuit.html#document/p3/a186753\">not reflected in state law</a>. In the California suit, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357171-cci-response-to-california-attorney-general.html#document/p20/a186756\">Corinthian said</a>, the state selectively pulled from emails and internal documents to create “out-of-context” and “misleading” impressions of the company’s job placement rates.</p>\r\n<p>“We have a vested interest in helping our graduates succeed in the job market,” said Jenkins. He added that Everest’s accreditation is tied to its ability to prove that its students are placed in jobs: It must submit job placement statistics and records to the school’s accrediting body.</p>\r\n<p>The lawsuits against the company <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p26/a186759\">allege</a> that those numbers, too, were falsified.</p>\r\n<p>Students told me that Everest’s advertised job placement programs were limited to things like reviewing resumes and, in many cases, were all but nonexistent. Several students said that Everest staff had simply forwarded them Craigslist postings or referred them to classified ads in local newspapers. Many said they had been placed in temporary jobs, called “externships,” which were pre-arranged with employers and lasted anywhere from a few days to months. But once they graduated and the temporary internships the school had placed them in were over, students said, they were unable to get back in touch with job placement staff.</p>\r\n<p>For Mary Parks, who graduated from Everest in January, Everest’s “job placement services” were limited to a single emailed job opportunity, a non-management internship at the retailer where she was already a cashier. After she told the school that she didn’t get the job, “I have not seen or heard from them since,” she said, despite emails to her caseworker. Parks has an associate degree in business management that cost $34,000, but is working a part-time job that pays just above minimum wage.</p>\r\n<p>Corinthian said it employs 600 career counselors for its 70,000 students, and that an internal corporate verification team checks the company’s job placement claims. “We know of no traditional college or university that has made a remotely comparable commitment to career services,” said Jenkins. Community colleges generally have much lower graduation rates and lower employment rates, and employ just a handful of career counselors per 1,000 students.</p>\r\n<p>Jenkins said that the company “does not promise employment to students, period,” and does not directly provide students with information about salaries, instead referring them to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>\r\n<p>Somehow, however, more than 50 students who contacted me came away from Everest with the impression that they had been “promised” jobs that they did not receive. Allegations in the Massachusetts lawsuit against Corinthian back up the students’ assertions: The <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p3/a186613\">suit alleges</a> “Corinthian employees promised or guaranteed employment despite knowing it could not fulfill such promises.”</p>\r\n<p>The Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, the country’s biggest for-profit college lobbying group, argues that even if they fail to immediately find well-paying jobs after graduation, students leave Everest and other for-profit schools better off than when they entered: At least they have a degree or certification, and thus a chance at a better job.</p>\r\n<p>But an overwhelming majority of the students that I spoke to believe the opposite: They said, often fiercely, that they wished they had never enrolled.</p>\r\n<p>“It was the worst decision of my life,” said Christine Gillan, who is $12,000 in debt for a medical assistant certificate she received in 2009. She never found a job in her field and now works as a cleaner at a health club.</p>\r\n<p>“It’s so sad that I worked so hard and have nothing to show for it,” said Tiffany Jones, a mother of four who graduated from an Everest program in medical billing in Reseda, California, last year, but never found a job in her field. Jenkins, the Corinthian spokesman, said the school had made several efforts to reach out to Jones, which she did not respond to, and had ultimately helped her set up a job interview. Her experience, he said, “demonstrates that employers value an Everest education and were willing to interview her.”</p>\r\n<p>At that interview, Jones said, the employer asked her why she had wasted her money on an Everest education instead of a different, cheaper school.

Everest <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p18/a186760\">consistently tells students</a> it is a “nationally accredited school,” and many students assume that means their credits are transferable; some students said they were specifically told that their credits would transfer. But while Everest is nationally accredited, almost all nonprofit schools have regional accreditations, and accept few, if any, Everest credits. Transferring in most parts of the country is all but impossible.</p>\r\n<p>Jenkins said students must initial a paragraph in an enrollment document stating that transferability is out of Everest’s control and that students “should expect credits not to transfer.” He noted that national accreditation, which is designed specifically for career programs, has more stringent standards than regional accreditation, such as job placement and graduation requirements that community colleges do not have to meet.</p>\r\n<p>He also pointed to a single state, Florida, where thanks to a statewide course record system, a selection of Everest’s courses are transferable to public universities.</p>\r\n<p>The lack of credit transferability works in Everest’s favor, interviews with former students show. Students who become dissatisfied with the school partway through their education, or who realize months into their program how expensive the degree will be, have no choice but to stay, unable to take their credits to community colleges or public schools.</p>\r\n<p>And if they want to further their education by getting a more advanced degree, such as an associate or bachelor’s, students said they had no choice but to return to Everest, even if they were dissatisfied with their original programs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255266\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-16107-1415924170-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-16107-1415924170-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"715\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 667px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255266','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-16107-1415924170-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Don Bartletti/Los Angeles Times / MCT</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Corinthian paid its CEO, Jack Massimino, more than $3 million in compensation last year, including a bonus of $1 million in what was the company’s worst fiscal year to date, according to SEC filings.

Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, the nation’s largest civil rights organization, is still a director; he joined soon after the company donated $1 million to his organization in 2012. Morial is paid upwards of $60,000 a year for his service on the board. A prominent Democrat, he was the mayor of New Orleans for eight years and once sat on President Obama’s Equity and Excellence in Education Commission, which was tasked with addressing opportunities for the federal government to address educational inequality.</p>\r\n<p>In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Morial said, “I joined the Corinthian board as someone who is committed to civil rights and equal opportunity for all and who has spent a lifetime working to advance that mission… As many institutions have increasingly shifted from extensive offerings of career and vocational training, a void has emerged across the country for students, especially non-traditional students, to have an opportunity to learn a trade and gain desirable workplace skills. The concept of increased vocational training to help fill this void is sound, and it absolutely must be delivered positively, ethically and within the law.”</p>\r\n<p>Another Corinthian director was Leon Panetta, the former secretary of defense, who sat on the board during the years of the school’s biggest growth, from 2008–2009. He left to join the Obama administration, then rejoined the board in 2013, a year after a <a href=\"http://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/for_profit_report/ExecutiveSummary.pdf\">Senate report on for-profit colleges</a> found Corinthian to be among the worst performers in the industry, with student loan default rates higher than any other publicly traded company. He left the board after just 11 weeks, <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/114041/leon-panetta-quits-corinthian-colleges-why\">facing pressure from critics</a> of Corinthian. Panetta declined to comment for this article.</p>\r\n<p>While the directors oversaw the business and were paid for their time, its owners were the biggest beneficiaries of its profits. One of the company’s largest shareholders has been Graham Holdings, formerly the Washington Post Company, which also owns Kaplan Inc., an education company and for-profit college chain.</p>\r\n<p>And throughout its troubled final years, Corinthian was supported by industry lobbyists, most notably the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, or APSCU. APSCU has been a force in Washington politics, most notably suing the Obama administration after a 2011 attempt to regulate the for-profit college industry, forcing the administration to revise the rules, delaying implementation for three years. Corinthian, an APSCU member, would have been among the hardest hit by those rules.</p>\r\n<p>But ultimately, taxpayers were the company’s largest supporter. Corinthian received 83% of its revenue from tax dollars at its enrollment peak in 2010, some $1.4 billion, and has raked in about $10 billion in the past 10 years. And it is taxpayers, through the federal student loan system, who will effectively act as debt collectors, chasing Everest’s former students for payment for the rest of their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4254364\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-5840-1415924540-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-5840-1415924540-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1047\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 999px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4254364','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-5840-1415924540-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">California Attorney General Kamala Harris. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Eric Risberg / AP Photo</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007, the California attorney general filed a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357643-california2007complaint-2.html\">lawsuit</a> against Corinthian Colleges, Everest’s parent company. California’s complaint against Everest and Corinthian included a litany of allegations: falsified job placement statistics, aggressive and unethical sales practices, and a pattern of jobless graduates carrying mountains of debt.</p>\r\n<p>But that case never went to trial: The lawsuit was immediately settled with no admission of wrongdoing on Corinthian’s part. The company paid a $500,000 civil penalty and $4.3 million in restitution to students at campuses that had notched the worst violations. As of this year, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on background, $3.4 million of that money has been paid out to 6,000 eligible students, for a total of approximately $560 each.</p>\r\n<p>Six years later, a new California attorney general, Kamala D. Harris, filed a new lawsuit against Corinthian that was, for the most part, indistinguishable from the first complaint, detailing the same violations, alleging that the company had materially broken every agreement made in the previous settlement. The recent federal lawsuit, and those in Massachusetts and Wisconsin, trace similar lines.</p>\r\n<p>The Department of Education began <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-heightens-oversight-corinthian-colleges\">its own investigation</a> into Corinthian in January, requesting details on everything from the company’s job placement rates to financial aid practices. In June, it claimed Corinthian was taking too long to respond completely, and temporarily cut off the school’s access to the federal financial aid money that made up almost 90% of its revenue. Corinthian was so short on cash that even the 21-day delay sent them into a financial tailspin, threatening bankruptcy; the DOE eventually agreed to release the funds, but only on the condition that Corinthian would sell off or close all of its campuses within six months. The final list included only 12 schools that would be shut down; Corinthian plans to sell the other 85, likely to a private equity firm or a for-profit competitor.</p>\r\n<p>But the lawsuits, investigations, and even the Department of Education’s forced shutdown are unlikely to result in any real change for the vast majority of Everest’s current and former students. One of the deep ironies of Corinthian’s collapse is that there are, experts say, effectively too many victims for there to be any reasonable way to compensate them, or to actually shut down the dozens of Everest campuses. It would cost the government billions to forgive the outstanding debt of former students, and any attempt to shut down Corinthian’s schools would displace 70,000 current ones.</p>\r\n<p>The lawsuit by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau seeks debt relief for students — but only on a tiny fraction of loans, those made directly by Corinthian, not the federal loans that make up the vast majority of students’ debt. Lawsuits in California, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts may provide some restitution to former students in those states, but like the 2007 settlement, would do little more than chip away at students’ loan tallies.</p>\r\n<p>Corinthian College’s impending demise will likely work against former students, said Pauline Abernathy, the vice president of policy organization The Institute for College Access and Success. “The issue is, if [the government] were to win a lawsuit, where would the money come from to compensate students?” Abernathy said.</p>\r\n<p>It’s all but impossible that any real money will come from Corinthian. Corinthian is so cash-strapped that it has been selling off assets — even equipment belonging to its chain of automotive schools — just to stay afloat until it finds a buyer for its campuses. It is extremely unlikely, experts agree, that any state would be able to recover a substantial settlement from the company.</p>\r\n<p>“The chances are slim” that former students will ever see any kind of meaningful debt relief, said Maura Dundon, senior policy counsel at the advocacy group Center for Responsible Lending.</p>\r\n<p>And because all former students signed arbitration agreements, Dundon said, they are unable to take part in class-action lawsuits in open court, and must instead take their cases to arbitration. That can be problematic because arbitration suits are difficult to file, and, in a more business-friendly environment, do not carry with them the right to appeal. “The worst thing is that the process is not public, so you can’t find out what the allegations are,” said Dundon.</p>\r\n<p>In the years between when the two lawsuits were filed in California, Everest boomed, reaching a height of 113,000 students in 2010. That was the year immediately after the economic crisis, when students flocked to for-profit schools in search of jobs. Enrollments — and revenues — fell sharply beginning in 2010, and Corinthian’s stock price slid alongside it. In 2009, the company was valued at around $1.4 billion. In the wake of the Education Department’s shutdown, its shares have been trading at around 18 cents, valuing the business at $14 million — just $2.5 million more than the asking price of Massimino’s house.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255398\" rel:buzz_num=\"15\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-30060-1415925325-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-30060-1415925325-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"759\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 711px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:15\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255398','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-30060-1415925325-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Jose Luis Magana / AP Photo</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Many Everest students who contacted me had deep misconceptions about the most basic financial aspects of their expensive educations, from the amount of tuition to who was shouldering the cost of their degree. Kelli McClendon, a former student of Everest College Online, wrote: “I was getting $5500 financial aid. The course was only $4500. Yet I found out I still had to take out loans to pay for my classes.” The cost of McClendon’s program was actually $13,500 — she had been told the cost for one quarter, rather than three.</p>\r\n<p>The students who told me that they were misled about the nature of their debts had all ostensibly gone through financial aid counseling, signing papers that listed the amount of money they were borrowing and the interest rates on their loans. That’s a government-mandated process, designed to ensure students understand the implications of the debt they are about to enter into.</p>\r\n<p>But interviews with former students and employees show Everest’s version of that process <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p34/a186789\">obscured the full cost of its education</a> and sometimes even led students to believe that they were not borrowing money at all. Some said their loans were misrepresented as grants that would not have to be repaid. Students said they were given a “tuition cost” that was per quarter or per credit, apparently without explaining that distinction. Others were told they would “pay nothing out of pocket,” or that the school would help them find “government-sector jobs” where they would not have to repay their loans.</p>\r\n<p>Failing to provide complete program costs to students is in violation of Corinthian’s policies, said Jenkins. “Any suggestion that clear information about the cost of programs is not made available to prospective students is demonstrably false,” he said. He pointed to Corinthian’s website, where, he said, “You can see that anyone can visit one of our websites and get the precise cost of any program and the availability of grants and loans to cover that cost.” (<a href=\"http://www.everest.edu/campus/chesapeake/program/criminal-justice\">This</a> is the type of page most students would navigate to find out program costs.)</p>\r\n<p>Admissions personnel were never allowed to discuss financial aid directly with students, according to the first former admissions representative — “they would fire you on the spot if you mentioned financial aid” — but were instead told to promise students that, once they had signed initial enrollment papers, they would be given financial aid counseling. But more often than not, she said, students left that single counseling session confused about what they had signed. “A couple days into class, I’d often get calls from students I enrolled saying, ‘I think I took out a loan? I don’t understand, what did this mean?’” she said. “But you couldn’t answer. You could only give them the runaround and say, ‘Don’t worry, you won’t have to pay it back until after you graduate.’”</p>\r\n<p>Often, the admissions representative said, and especially with students who spoke limited English, “I got the impression they didn’t know what they were signing.”</p>\r\n<p>Though they were presented with papers that would have explained the terms and amounts of the grants and loans they were taking out, many students said they were not given time to read the papers. They instead trusted the words of their financial aid counselors, who promised to “explain everything.”</p>\r\n<p>One former financial aid counselor at Everest College-Phoenix said she and other representatives “never discussed anything about the total cost of attendance” with students. When total costs came up, students were quickly assured they would be “covered by financial aid.” By the end of a single phone call with online students, the financial aid counselor said, she had signed students up for tens of thousands of dollars in loans, often without the student’s full understanding of what they had agreed to.</p>\r\n<p>Everest educations are expensive: More than five times as expensive as a degree from a community college, and twice as expensive as a degree from a state university. The cost is no accident; it’s largely a by-product of a federal rule governing for-profit colleges, known as “the 90/10 rule,” which mandates that schools can draw a maximum of 90% of their revenue from federal aid money.</p>\r\n<p>Everest’s tuition is set at a price high enough that some students eventually max out their federal aid, forcing them to turn to other sources to pay for the final slice of their tuition, often around $5,000. Usually, that “funding gap” is covered by a private loan made by Everest itself, called a Genesis loan, which charges a maximum of 9.9% interest, nearly twice as much as an unsubsidized loan made by the federal government.</p>\r\n<p>Dozens of students said that they were not informed ahead of time that they would need to take out private loans in addition to government funding. Most said they were told within months or even weeks of graduation that they had “run out of funding, and that if they wanted to graduate, they would need to sign up for a Genesis loan.”</p>\r\n<p>Jenkins noted that less than 40% of Corinthian’s students take out private loans. “This program was never intended to be and has never been a profit center,” he said.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255314\" rel:buzz_num=\"13\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-19571-1415924718-5.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-19571-1415924718-5.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"873\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 825px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:13\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255314','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-19571-1415924718-5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Paula Dougherty, who is studying business administration at Everest, lives in rural Warrior, Alabama. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Molly Hensley-Clancy for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Paula Dougherty isn’t sure how much money she’s paying for a two-year associate degree in business administration at Everest University Online; she was never told, and she never asked. When Dougherty thinks about money, she thinks in smaller sums. Five dollars’ worth of gas for her cousin’s truck to get from her home in rural Alabama to her doctor’s appointments. Money for groceries when her family’s food stamps run out.</p>\r\n<p>Dougherty is unemployed and living on $700 a month in disability payments; she has only ever had one job, as a greeter at Walmart, which lasted two months. Four hundred dollars are eaten up in rent for a bedroom in a mobile home on the outskirts of Warrior, Alabama, which she shares with her aunt, uncle, cousin, his wife, and a dozen dogs and cats.</p>\r\n<p>So the stipend checks Dougherty gets from Everest every semester — essentially cash payments taken from student loans — are more than a bonus. The payments, sometimes up to $900, have become a necessity. “I need them for gas and rent,” she said. “If we’re low on food and run out of stamps, we go hungry for a while. If I have one of those checks, I can go out and buy food.”</p>\r\n<p>What Everest calls “stipend checks” are refunds of federal loan dollars — what is left over from the money students borrow for their educations. The government allows borrowing up to a maximum amount, which includes the costs of housing and supplies. Many low-income students, like Dougherty, said they are reliant on these sums to cover basic costs; several said the money was the primary reason they remained enrolled.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255452\" rel:buzz_num=\"20\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3509316_4255452\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3509316_4255452\"}}' rel:description=\"Depending on who you ask, the fact that for-profit colleges disproportionately enroll poor and minority students is either a troubling example of exploitation — or of an industry stepping up to serve students who might otherwise have no access to a degree.\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:20\"></a>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-twitter-share fa fa-twitter\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"twitter3509316_4255452\" rel:via=\"molly_hc  \" rel:sub_title=\"Depending%20on%20who%20you%20ask,%20the%20fact%20that%20for-profit%20colleges%20di\" rel:adtl_tweet_text=\" \" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"tw-share\":{\"id\":\"3509316_4255452\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/list-item:20\"></a>\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3509316_4255452\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3509316_4255452\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:20\" rel:count=\"14\"></a>\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\t<blockquote class=\"\" style=\"font-family: 'News Cycle'; font-weight: 700; line-height: 1.3000000000000003em; font-size: 25px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #224178; \">Depending on who you ask, the fact that for-profit colleges disproportionately enroll poor and minority students is either a troubling example of exploitation — or of an industry stepping up to serve students who might otherwise have no access to a degree.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on whom you ask, the fact that for-profit colleges disproportionately enroll poor and minority students is either a troubling example of exploitation — or of an industry stepping up to serve students who might otherwise have no access to a college degree. For-profit colleges say they offer poor and working students things that public and nonprofit colleges cannot: job-centric degrees, flexible course schedules for single parents and full-time workers, environments geared toward older students and veterans rather than recent high school graduates.</p>\r\n<p>The numbers behind the industry as a whole are troubling: Just 13% of American higher-education students attend for-profit colleges, but they account for 30% of all outstanding student loans — and almost half of student loan defaults. The graduation rate stands at 32%. But the for-profit college industry defends those figures by saying they are explained by the schools’ demographics: Studies have shown poor students are less likely to graduate, and it stands to reason that they have to borrow much more too. They also frequently compare themselves to community colleges, where graduation rates are actually lower and loan default rates often equally as high.</p>\r\n<p>Community colleges are significantly less expensive: an average of $8,500 vs. $35,000, meaning that only 42% of community college students are forced to go into debt for two-year degrees, compared with more than 88% of for-profit college students. They borrow, on average, twice as much as community college students.</p>\r\n<p>The for-profit college industry has also come under fire for much more than its student borrowing and graduation rates. Corinthian is widely known as being among the worst offenders in the industry, but it’s far from alone in its record of legal action. In January, attorneys general in 12 states announced investigations into the practices of three massive publicly traded for-profits: EDMC, ITT Educational Services, and Career Education Corporation. EDMC, which recently delisted itself from the stock exchange, faced a similar investigation in 2010; the 55,000-student ITT Educational is being investigated by the SEC and sued, like Corinthian, by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>\r\n<p>The University of Phoenix, the country’s largest and best-known for-profit, has been investigated in several different states. It <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/university-phoenix-settles-false-claims-act-lawsuit-675-million\">settled with the Justice Department</a> over its recruiting practices for $67 million in 2009, after a government review, according to the <a href=\"http://archive.azcentral.com/families/education/articles/0914apollo14.html\"><i>Arizona Republic</i></a>, “paint[ed] a picture of a school so hungry to enroll new students that it has threatened and intimidated its recruitment staff in meetings and e-mail, pressured them to enroll unqualified students and covered up its practices to deceive regulators.”</p>\r\n<p>For its part, the Obama administration has tried — and, so far, failed — to impose meaningful regulations on the industry. In 2011, the administration rolled out a series of so-called “gainful-employment” regulations meant to shut down the worst-performing career college programs. Programs were required to meet one of two metrics relating to loan repayment and debt-to-income ratios. Those that failed were disproportionately for-profit college programs.</p>\r\n<p>Many critics of the industry actually regarded the 2011 regulations as too lax, criticizing the administration for bowing to the demands of for-profit college lobbyists. The most prominent for-profit lobby group sued the Education Department anyway, and the rules were thrown out on a technical argument that the metrics chosen by the department were arbitrary.</p>\r\n<p>Last week, the administration released a new version of the regulations that, though tougher than the 2011 iteration, caved in to a key lobbying demand by the for-profit college industry. Some lawmakers are skeptical the new regulations will work as hoped. “I do not believe that this rule will be enough to prevent bad actors in the for-profit sector from gaming the system and taking advantage of our students,” said Rep. Mark Takano, a California Democrat, in a statement. APSCU, the for-profit college lobbying organization, has already filed a lawsuit to strike down the new attempt at regulation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255297\" rel:buzz_num=\"21\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-21817-1415925007-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-21817-1415925007-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1019px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:21\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255297','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-21817-1415925007-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">A photograph of Jennifer Wilson at her graduation from Everest. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph Molly Hensley-Clancey for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Jennifer Wilson still keeps a framed portrait in her living room of herself at graduation, beaming in a cap and gown and holding a leather folder that reads “Everest University” against her chest. She was so happy in that moment, she said: She had finally graduated from college — a dream she’d had since she was a teenager — with an associate of science degree in criminal justice. She was on her way, she hoped, to a better job.</p>\r\n<p>But Wilson, who lives in Cape Coral, Florida, was yet to understand the extent of the debt she was carrying. “I had no idea how much my loans were coming to,” she said; she had been rushed through the signing process without anybody mentioning the total cost of her program. Weeks after graduation, she started getting bills for the rest of her student loan debt. The total cost of her two-year associate degree: $40,000.</p>\r\n<p>She would soon find her degree was essentially “worthless,” she said, and came with none of the job placement services she’d been promised. No police departments would hire her, although she’d been told her program had a near-perfect job placement rate; it was 2010, so some blamed the economy, but others said it was because of the quality of her degree.</p>\r\n<p>At her local community college, Wilson learned, a similar two-year degree would have cost around $7,000.</p>\r\n<p>By then, the joy of that Everest cap-and-gown moment was long gone. It had begun to fade even on graduation day. As she walked off the stage that afternoon, she opened the embossed folder for a first look at her diploma; instead, she found a letter from Everest, demanding that she pay $3,000 in private loans she still owed the school. Until she paid up, she wouldn’t officially graduate or receive her diploma.

He saw Michael Sam Jr. kiss his boyfriend and hug his small team of supporters — agents, coaches, and Pro Football Hall of Famer Jim Brown. The first out gay player drafted into the National Football League strode to the stage to receive ESPN’s Arthur Ashe Award, an honor previously bestowed on Muhammad Ali, Pat Tillman, and Nelson Mandela. It was the climax of a star-studded evening in Los Angeles meant to announce Michael Jr.’s arrival as a national icon.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_small image_lfrs  \" id=\"superlist_3508884_4241516\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr05/longform-6527-1415813870-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr05/longform-6527-1415813870-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"353\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 305px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4241516','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr05/longform-6527-1415813870-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Michael Sam accepts the Arthur Ashe Courage Award onstage during the 2014 ESPY Awards in Los Angeles. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Michael Buckner / Getty Images For ESPYS</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Jr. thanked his agents, his publicist, the couple who welcomed him into their home in high school, supporters from the University of Missouri, and top officials with the St. Louis Rams, the team that had drafted him only two months earlier.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, he gave a brief nod to his roots. “To my mother, a single mother who somehow raised eight kids. I love you dearly.”</p>\r\n<p>Back in his cramped room at the nursing home, Michael Sam Sr. picked up his battered, flip-style phone and found his son’s number. He left a message.</p>\r\n<p>“So that’s what you’re going to do?” he recalled telling his son. “After all I’ve done for you?”</p>\r\n<p>Since Michael Jr. publicly announced he was gay in February — just days after he let his father know by text message — Michael Sr. has been vilified in the press. In the <i>New York Times</i>, Michael Sr. came off as a callous homophobe when he said, “I don’t want my grandkids raised in that kind of environment. … I’m old school. I’m a man-and-a-woman type of guy.” When the ESPN documentary declared that Michael Sr. had “abandoned the family” and left his mother to raise Michael Jr. and his seven siblings on her own, Michael Sr. seemed the archetype of the intolerant and absent black father.</p>\r\n<p>In none of these accounts did Michael Jr. come to his father’s defense. “I’m closer to my friends than I am to my family,” Michael Jr. told the <i>T</i><i>imes</i>.</p>\r\n<p>But the father-son story of Michael Sr. and Michael Jr. is more than a conflict over whether Michael Sr. loved and supported his son. It’s the tale of man who’s been reduced to a caricature but whose actual life was shaped by the loss of child after child, some to death and some to crime. The rift between Michael Sr. and his youngest son started long before Michael Jr. came out and stems in no small part from those family tragedies.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, those losses shaped Michael Jr. too, but he isn’t saying how. Through his agent and publicist, he declined numerous requests for an interview. But it’s not hard to see how, in order to succeed and perhaps just to survive, he might blame his father, fairly or not, for what happened to his family.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4240900\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/11/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-32093-1415810626-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/11/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-32093-1415810626-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1407\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1324px; top: 432px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4240900','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/11/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-32093-1415810626-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Joel Anderson/BuzzFeed</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Sr. spends most of his days at the DeSoto Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, about 15 miles southwest of Dallas. His electric hospital-style bed and almost all of his few belongings — a mini-fridge and a rolling dinner tray, mostly — are crammed into a corner of the room he shares with another patient. He locks his drawers because someone has been stealing his snacks.</p>\r\n<p>He gets around in a wheelchair, having lost his ability to walk almost three years ago. He wears a gold chain around his broad neck, which bears a deep and long surgical scar that runs from the bottom of his hairline to somewhere past the neckline of his white undershirt. It’s not clear he knows exactly what ailment has left him in a wheelchair. “I have a hole in my neck,” he said. “But I ain’t gonna die in this motherfucker. I’m getting out of here.”</p>\r\n<p>At 55, he’s one of the youngest and most vibrant residents at the nursing home. He has a paunch and false teeth, but he still possesses the thickly muscled shoulders and arms of someone nicknamed “Hammer,” a handle he got on the football field and in the streets. His hands still make large fists; kicking ass was a family pastime.</p>\r\n<p>“Maaaannnn, I used to hit hard,” he said. “I taught all my sons to play football.”</p>\r\n<p>He often rolls his wheelchair to a shaded patio, where he goes through Kool cigarettes like some people do cups of coffee. He banters with almost everyone. Especially the women. “Better quit bending that ass over like that,” he tells one of the women staffers, a smile creasing his fleshy face. The woman smiles back. If she or other women staffers are offended by his behavior, they don’t show it. At least a couple jokingly call him their boyfriend.</p>\r\n<p>His phone rings throughout the day, bearing calls from his children or friends named ”Frank Tha Cook” or “Little Leroy.” The conversations usually cover his health, upcoming casino trips to Louisiana, and football, particularly the Cowboys, his favorite team since he was a boy.</p>\r\n<p>One person who doesn’t call is Michael Jr., who kept his distance as he ascended to fame and more recently when he tumbled out of big-time football.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3508884_4242159\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/13/enhanced/webdr09/longform-952-1415816911-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/13/enhanced/webdr09/longform-952-1415816911-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"319\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 271px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4242159','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/13/enhanced/webdr09/longform-952-1415816911-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Michael Sam in 2013 playing for the University of Missouri. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Joe Robbins / Getty Images</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After Michael Jr. publicly came out in February, even President Obama <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/draft2014/story/_/id/10468033/president-barack-obama-applauds-missouri-michael-sam-coming-out\">praised the announcement</a>. On May 10, the St. Louis Rams drafted him, generating more praise. But despite the fact that he had been a star at the University of Missouri, where he became Co-Defensive Player of the Year in the powerful Southeastern Conference, he was chosen late. Only seven players were selected after him. He performed well during training camp and the preseason — but was still cut from the final roster on Aug. 30, touching off a debate about whether homophobia played a role in his release. The Cowboys signed him three days later to their practice squad, then dropped him on Oct. 21. He is now a free agent.</p>\r\n<p>For the nearly two months that Michael Jr. was with the Cowboys, he lived a half hour away from his father. It was the closest they’ve lived to each other in about 15 years. A family friend, Sean Woods, hoped it would finally bring the men together. “Now,” he said, Michael Jr. “has to deal with his daddy.”</p>\r\n<p>Yet the Michaels have exchanged only a few text messages and haven’t spoken a word to each other, a quiet that has now lasted at least several months with no end in sight. Michael Sr. has mostly kept up with the vicissitudes of his son’s career through updates on ESPN and phone calls from friends and family members.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly after Michael Jr. was released from the Cowboys’ practice squad, Michael Sr. sent a text to BuzzFeed News: “Hey they cut Mike.” Asked if he’d heard from his son recently, Michael Sr. texted back that Michael Jr. “wouldn’t say a word to me honer [sic] thy father.”</p>\r\n<p>“It’s like he was looking for an excuse to separate from us,” Michael Sr. said. “Now we’re just letting him have his limelight. We’re tired of begging him to stay in the family.”</p>\r\n<p>On the room’s walls, Michael Sr. has pinned Father’s Day cards, a corkboard with a calendar and pictures of his family, and, over his bed, a lengthy poem about angels. On a special spot on the wall — right over his flat-screen TV — are two pictures of Michael Jr. in his University of Missouri football uniform. Pointing at the pictures, Michael Sr. said he knew from the start that Michael Jr. would be special.</p>\r\n<p>“That boy, he had some big nuts,” Michael Sr. said. “He was big when he was born. That boy had some big-ass balls.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4240913\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-2794-1415827237-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-2794-1415827237-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"436\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 388px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4240913','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-2794-1415827237-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Paul Moseley/Fort Worth Star-Telegram / MCT</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Wesley Sam, Michael Sr.’s father, was also pretty ballsy. In 1947, he was living in Opelousas, Louisiana, when he heard on the radio about what’s generally considered <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_City_disaster#Scale_of_the_disaster\">the deadliest industrial accident in U.S. history</a>, an explosion at the Monsanto plant near Galveston, Texas. He headed right to the scene, figuring he could get work there.</p>\r\n<p>He loaded cotton at the Galveston wharves for a few months before landing a job at the Monsanto plant. Yes, it had blown up, killing nearly 600 people, but he could make more money there than a black man could expect almost anywhere else.</p>\r\n<p>He married Alberta, a fellow Opelousas native who spoke Creole, little English, and who couldn’t read or write. With their 10 children, they moved into a three-bedroom, one-bathroom home at 1732 Thompson St. in La Marque: Wesley and Alberta had a bedroom, the girls had one, and the boys had the room at the back of the house. “I had a white boy type of life at home,” Michael Sr. said. “There wasn’t nothing I couldn’t have wanted and gotten.”</p>\r\n<p>Alberta died at 46 following “a brief illness,” according to her obituary in the <i>La Marque Times</i>. Wesley Sam was a loving man, a capable cook, and obsessive about cleanliness — he would dust off his car every day, his surviving children said. But he wasn’t quite up to the challenge of corralling all of those children. Who could? Instead he set his example through his work ethic, putting in a full day at Monsanto then mowing lawns with his sons in the evening. They’d do 18 yards a day, Wednesday through Sunday.</p>\r\n<p>“My dad was a workaholic before anyone called it that,” Michael Sr. said. “He’d think you were sorry if you didn’t have that work mentality in you.”</p>\r\n<p>Michael Sr.’s siblings went off to college, joined the military, and found middle-class jobs. His sister Geraldine would become La Marque’s first black mayor.</p>\r\n<p>Michael Sr., meanwhile, dropped out of school over the protests of his father but earned a GED. He wasn’t much of a student anyway, and finding work in the area was a cinch for anyone who didn’t mind getting a few smudges on their shirt. He worked in construction, at a chemical plant, and as a crane operator and a forklift operator.</p>\r\n<p>Away from work, Michael Sr. and his brothers drank, chased women, and kept up the family tradition of fisticuffs. “We’d be out in the front yard fighting,” Michael Sr. said, grinning at the memory. “Real fighting. Not no slapboxing.”</p>\r\n<p>One night in 1978, Michael Sr. met a woman named JoAnn Turner at a local nightclub. “She was fine and good-looking,” Michael Sr. said. “And I walked her out.”</p>\r\n<p>Little more than a year later, JoAnn gave birth to a boy they named Russell. A year later, they had daughter Chanel. Julian was born in June 1982. They were young and in love, with three kids and jobs that paid middle-class wages. It didn’t take long for Michael Sr. to settle into life as a family man, or long for it to be destroyed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4241207\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-31269-1415811985-14.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-31269-1415811985-14.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"697\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 649px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4241207','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-31269-1415811985-14.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Dylan Hollingsworth for BuzzFeed</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Here’s a news brief from the Associated Press on Sept. 23, 1982, with a dateline from Texas City: “The body of Chanel Roshaun Sam was found Monday night in about eight feet of water near a pier on which she had been playing. Her parents and neighbors searched for three hours before finding the body.” The little girl, 2 years old, had apparently drowned.</p>\r\n<p>After several days of grief, and desperate to rescue JoAnn from her despair, Michael Sr. suggested they go to the courthouse. And so, six days after their daughter died, they were married.</p>\r\n<p>“I felt like she needed some support,” Michael Sr. said. “It was the right thing to do, to bring something positive from it.”</p>\r\n<p>It wasn’t enough. JoAnn turned to religion and became a Jehovah’s Witness. Her conversion deepened the fissure in her marriage, because Michael Sr. was raised as a Baptist and felt his wife’s new religion was too restrictive. She insisted the family not celebrate Christmas. “I celebrated it,” he said. “But she didn’t celebrate it with me. I still bought the kids gifts.” (JoAnn didn’t respond to requests for an interview.)</p>\r\n<p>Michael Sr. found his solace shooting dice. On Friday and Saturday evenings, he would take his paycheck to a little wooden shack in Texas City and gamble away the family’s money. JoAnn suspected the absences were because of another woman, Michael Sr. said. But a mutual friend of the couple gave her the scoop. In Michael Sr.’s version of the story, the woman told JoAnn that “he ain’t screwing none of us” but was just gambling.</p>\r\n<p>One Friday night, Michael Sr. recalled, he won $700 and left the shack with two friends on an impromptu trip to Boy’s Town in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, an infamous red-light district just across the Texas border. He didn’t bother calling JoAnn to tell her that he was leaving town.</p>\r\n<p>“Weren’t no cell phones back then, and I didn’t stop and spend the 25 cents to call,” he said. When he returned Sunday, “she bitched at my ass. But it was pretty funny. I had a blast.”</p>\r\n<p>The marriage continued to spiral, though Joshua was born in 1984 and Christopher in 1985. Michael Sr. finally filed for divorce in February 1986. A brief attempt at reconciliation resulted in the birth of Michelle in 1987. But the divorce was granted in 1988.</p>\r\n<p>JoAnn was awarded primary parental responsibilities. Michael Sr. would have access to the children two weekends each month, and they divided up the holidays.</p>\r\n<p>Michael Sr. was also ordered to pay JoAnn $250 each month for child support. Within a few months, JoAnn returned to court to complain that Michael Sr. wasn’t meeting his obligation. Thus started a four-year battle over child support. Michael Sr. was charged with contempt of court at least 10 times stemming from his failure to pay, according to court records. Twice he was sent to county jail.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3508884_4242796\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr09/longform-12326-1415824077-18.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr09/longform-12326-1415824077-18.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"440\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 392px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4242796','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr09/longform-12326-1415824077-18.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">The District Clerk's Office of Galveston County</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>“It was because I was running around and spending money and shooting dice,” Michael Sr. said.

At that point, according to court documents, Michael Sr. was behind nearly $4,000 in payments.</p>\r\n<p>During the Christmas holidays that year, Michael Sr. said, JoAnn made a surprise visit to his house. “She wore one of those Mormon dresses — she knows that I like dresses,” he said, laughing. This time, he said, she demanded more than a night together.</p>\r\n<p>On May 3, 1993, Michael Sr. and JoAnn went to the county courthouse once again — to get remarried.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4242886\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/14/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-31737-1415820173-34.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/14/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-31737-1415820173-34.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"819\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 771px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4242886','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/14/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-31737-1415820173-34.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Dylan Hollingsworth for BuzzFeed</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Sr. took no small pride in raising sons who were every bit the hell-raiser that he was. People around the neighborhood called him a man’s man. “My dad didn’t take no shit off nobody, and I didn’t take no shit off nobody,” Michael Sr. said. “I wasn’t a bad guy. But I was a ‘I’ll kick your ass’ kind of guy.”</p>\r\n<p>“All of his kids were muscular and some bad dudes,” said Charles Sam, Michael Sr.’s brother.</p>\r\n<p>The toughest of the bunch was also the oldest: Russell. As a freshman, he was pegged as a future football star at La Marque High School. Michael Sr. fondly remembers how Russell would walk around the neighborhood, “always ready to slap a motherfucker.”</p>\r\n<p>But, he said, “I kept telling him to get out of that gang shit.”</p>\r\n<p>Here’s a clipping from the Galveston County <i>Daily News</i>. It reports that on Feb. 27, 1995, Russell was sent home early from La Marque High School for “creating a disturbance.” A school administrator allowed Russell to walk home since his mother couldn’t leave work to pick him up.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of heading straight home, the newspaper said, Russell stopped at a house about a half mile from the school. He was breaking into the back door when the homeowner fired at him three times through a metal door. Russell was clutching a screwdriver when his body was found. No charges were filed against the homeowner (who was also black).</p>\r\n<p>The anger welled up within Michael Sr., who casually knew the man who had killed his son. There weren’t many strangers on that side of town. Michael Sr. got himself a handgun. “I was going to kill him,” Michael Sr. said. “I was going to go over there and end him. But my daddy saved me. He wouldn’t let me go over there.”</p>\r\n<p>His father saved him<i>.</i> But Michael Sr. couldn’t save his own sons.</p>\r\n<p>At 5 feet 4 inches and 125 pounds, second-oldest son Julian had an unusually slight build for a Sam boy. He went by the nickname “Ice Pick.” But he had a left arm that was made for pitching. “That boy could throw,” Michael Sr. said. “He used to strike Russell out all the time. Those were the funnest days.”</p>\r\n<p>But, Michael Sr. said, “he wanted his own money” and begged his father to let him work. Michael Sr. eventually gave in, and Julian took a job with a local cable company.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_narrow image_lfcn no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3508884_4242912\" rel:buzz_num=\"10\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/14/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-mid-9539-1415820279-16.png\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/14/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-mid-9539-1415820279-16.png\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"720\" height=\"275\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 637px; top: 227px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:10\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4242912','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/14/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-mid-9539-1415820279-16.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">The Daily News</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Here’s another headline from <i>The Daily News</i>, this one from Oct. 22, 1998: “La Marque mother looks for clues into son’s disappearance.”</p>\r\n<p>Julian was last seen outside La Marque’s high school football stadium, where he had gone to buy tickets to the homecoming game.

It seemed isolated enough from the troubles that La Marque had visited upon their family, but it wasn’t.</p>\r\n<p>La Marque police reopened the investigation into Julian’s disappearance after getting reports that people had seen him in the area. “We think he left on his own free will and we feel strongly he is alive,” the police chief told the <i>Texas City Sun</i> in October 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243014\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/14/enhanced/webdr05/longform-19920-1415820638-28.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/14/enhanced/webdr05/longform-19920-1415820638-28.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"375\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 327px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243014','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/14/enhanced/webdr05/longform-19920-1415820638-28.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">An age-progressed photo of Julian Sam. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children / Via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.missingkids.com/poster/NCMC/1193249/1\">missingkids.com</a></span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>JoAnn told the <i>Sun</i> that she also believed he was still alive. “He was at that age of rebellion,” she said, suggesting he had run away from home. She told the newspaper that she wanted him to come home or at least call someone in the family to let them know he was OK.</p>\r\n<p>In grief, Michael Sr. had quit his job at the post office. “I had always had a steady job, but I couldn’t handle it no more,” he said. “I felt closed in. Just thinking of it.” He found work as a crane operator but was laid off soon after. He got a job working for a local pipe company and was let go again. Finally, in the fall of 1999, a family friend told him he should consider truck driving. Michael Sr. went to school in Dallas, and four months later was on the road, coming back to Hitchcock when he could, mostly on weekends.</p>\r\n<p>“It was a steady job,” he said, and one that answered a deeper need: “I had to get away. I wanted to get away.”</p>\r\n<p>The marriage crumbled. Michael Sr. and JoAnn remain legally married but haven’t lived as a couple since he moved to Dallas in 2000.</p>\r\n<p>Michael Jr. was 10 when his father started his life on the road. With JoAnn working late hours and taking extra shifts to provide for the children, Michael Jr.’s older brothers had their run of the house — and the streets. “It was bad,” Michael Jr. said in an ESPN documentary about his life. “I’m a kid and I’m seeing some hardcore drugs in my house. My mother didn’t know about it. If I told her anything, my brothers said they would kill me.”</p>\r\n<p>Craig Smith, one of his high school football coaches, saw it for himself. “Sometimes I’d drive over to pick him up and honk the horn and one of his brothers would come out to see if I wanted to buy” drugs, he told a crowd at the school’s annual football reunion dinner in late July.</p>\r\n<p>The criminal records of Michael Jr.’s brothers support these accounts: Josh has been arrested more than 40 times, including four convictions for drug possession, and Chris has tallied nearly 20 arrests.</p>\r\n<p>In April, Chris was sentenced to 30 years in state prison for breaking into a woman’s home, choking her into unconsciousness twice, then using her credit card at a nearby restaurant. Josh was put in the Galveston County Jail in July on a minor offense and was released last month.</p>\r\n<p>“I got caught up in them streets,” Josh admitted during a June interview with BuzzFeed News, a rare evening this year when he wasn’t locked up.</p>\r\n<p>Little of this came as a surprise to family members. Cousins remember being warned to keep their distance. “We knew it wasn’t the ideal upbringing,” said Joseph Sam, a nephew of Michael Sr. “They were always in trouble.”</p>\r\n<p>With his childhood saturated with grief and his older brothers descending into crime, Michael Jr. would have had to be a saint not to look for someone to blame. Conveniently, his father was already blaming himself.</p>\r\n<p>Out on the road, far away from home, Michael Sr. remained tormented by the loss of his boys. Teaching them toughness had backfired; he’d armed them with tools for survival in one world that wouldn’t work in almost any other.</p>\r\n<p>“Life was going to be tough on them,” he said. “Your skin had to be tougher than the others. But I also wanted them to make the right decisions.”</p>\r\n<p>Somewhere in these years, Michael Sr. began to lose the last of his sons — not to death or crime, but to rejection.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4242977\" rel:buzz_num=\"11\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-6687-1415827301-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-6687-1415827301-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"436\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 388px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:11\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4242977','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-6687-1415827301-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Robert Dohman</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>On his first day of third grade, in a new town and new school, Michael Jr. was seated next to a chubby, snowy-haired boy. Michael Jr. wasn’t saying much to his new seatmate. The silence went on for so long and got so awkward that eventually the boy spoke up.</p>\r\n<p>“I told the teacher that I didn’t want to sit next to him because he was too quiet,” said Robert Dohman. “He turns around and goes, ‘Hey, blondie boy, I’m not quiet!’ And that’s the way me and Michael get along now.”</p>\r\n<p>Michael Jr. was voted “friendliest” by his sixth-grade classmates and elected homecoming king in eighth grade. His popularity was a testament to his ability to navigate the unspoken color line of a small Southern town; most of his close friends were white.</p>\r\n<p>“My grandma,” said Dohman, “was very old-school and wasn’t into all that racial mixing. But when I had Michael over, he’d always be the first one to come over and give everybody a hug. Even her. He really changed the way my grandmother looked at black people. She would even smile when he came around.”</p>\r\n<p>Michael Sr. said he saw little of the outgoing side of his son, saying he was quiet at home. But coaches and teachers remember him as a precociously self-assured teenager who could start a conversation with anyone. After football games, Michael Jr. was known for going into the bleachers — uniform and pads still on — to introduce himself to parents.</p>\r\n<p>Michael could “talk to a group of 15-year-olds and then set there and talk to a group of 55-year-olds and not feel out of place either,” said Smith, now head football coach at Hitchcock. “I just never had a student that could just go and talk to a group of people. He would make friends all the time.”</p>\r\n<p>Even in what was ostensibly enemy territory. Smith recalled a track meet at Danbury, a nearby town that is 90% white, less than 1% black, and had developed a reputation for being unfriendly to minorities. Except, apparently, Michael Jr.</p>\r\n<p>“I can remember some Danbury parents cheering and rooting for Michael running the 100-meter” dash, Coach Smith said. “You just didn’t see that, if you know anything about Danbury.”</p>\r\n<p>Maybe the biggest benefit of playing sports is that it kept Michael Jr. away from his brothers. The coaches, who also worked as teachers in the district, knew all about Josh and Chris: Their obvious athleticism had never proven to be worth the trouble. But Michael Jr. was charting a path different from the men in his family. Michael Jr. greeted people with hugs, not fists. He was going to be the first to graduate.</p>\r\n<p>“Michael was a good kid,” Michael Sr. said. “He said he didn’t want to be like his brothers.” Left unsaid was that Michael Jr. clearly felt the same about his father.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243125\" rel:buzz_num=\"13\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-27645-1415829145-39.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-27645-1415829145-39.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"436\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 388px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:13\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243125','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-27645-1415829145-39.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Robert Dohman</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>On fall Friday nights, Michael Sr. said he would find a seat somewhere in Hitchcock’s football stadium, away from the crowd and sometimes with his father, Wesley. After nearly 30 years as a father, he said, he could finally engage in the autumn ritual familiar across Texas.</p>\r\n<p>“I didn’t miss [any] home game his senior year,” Michael Sr. insisted.</p>\r\n<p>There isn’t anyone who can corroborate his perfect attendance. Family and friends say they’re sure he went to some games but don’t know about all of them. The coaches at Hitchcock High can remember seeing or, rather, hearing, Michael Sr. only once in four years: a game in Michael Jr.’s sophomore year.</p>\r\n<p>“I heard this guy yelling at Michael and I turned to Michael and asked him, ‘Who the hell is that guy?’” Smith recalled. “Michael said it was his father. That’s the only time I’ve ever seen him.”</p>\r\n<p>Those stadiums can be hubs of activity on Friday nights, and coaches are notoriously focused on the events unfolding well away from the stands. It would be easy to miss someone on game night, <i>right</i>?</p>\r\n<p>“Let me say this in a nice way,” Smith said. “I didn’t know him, and I know a lot of people in town. I can look up in those stands and know who’s there.”</p>\r\n<p>Michael Sr. said he didn’t make it a priority to spend any time with the parents of Michael Jr.’s friends or the alums and other regulars who would show up at school events — most of them white. “I never did know them,” Michael Sr. said. “And I never tried to go out of my way.”</p>\r\n<p>Michael Sr. said he took a job with a trucking company based out of Ada, Oklahoma, so that he could arrive in Hitchcock by the start of kickoff Friday night. He assumed his son appreciated what he considered a significant sacrifice of time and money; coming back to Texas without a load meant he wouldn’t get paid for the drive home.</p>\r\n<p>It wasn’t until earlier this year, when media outlets began saying that he had abandoned his son, that Michael Sr. learned he was being phased out of the story of his son’s childhood. He never thought all those years on the road would mean that he wasn’t there.</p>\r\n<p>“Michael’s family was the city of Hitchcock,” said Dohman, Michael Jr.’s childhood friend.</p>\r\n<p>Told what Dohman said, Michael Sr. looked straight ahead, the anger washing over him. Sitting on that patio at the nursing home, he was, for a few moments, that angry Sam boy ready to fight.</p>\r\n<p>“The city of Hitchcock didn’t buy his goddamn clothes, a roof over his head, or the bed that he slept in,” Michael Sr. said. “The city of Hitchcock can kiss my ass.” He paused. “I should have kept those gas receipts.”</p>\r\n<p>Of course, Michael Sr. never thought he would need them. He also never thought the family of a high school teammate — a white one — would get so much credit.</p>\r\n<p>Once Michael Jr. revealed in February his plans to become the NFL’s first out gay player, the two media outlets with which his publicists coordinated the announcement wrote this:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/sports/football/for-nfl-prospect-michael-sam-upbringing-was-bigger-challenge-than-coming-out-as-gay.html?_r=1\">The <i>New York Times</i></a>: Sam found a comfortable place off the field as well, in large part because of Ethan Purl, a classmate and the son of Ron Purl, the president of the local branch of Prosperity Bank. Ron’s wife, Candy, made sure their house was part recreation center and part counseling hub for their children and their friends. By Sam’s senior year, he had his own bedroom in the Purls’ house, along with chores like cleaning the pool and carrying the grocery bags. “I look at our house as a kind of safe haven,” said Ron Purl, who keeps a photograph of Sam in his Missouri football uniform in his office. “He is just another son. If he did something wrong, he got yelled at just like the others did.”</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/10453954/michael-sam-safe-havens-football-surrogate-family\">ESPN</a>: The relationship started when Candy Purl, Ronnie’s wife, invited Michael to dinner during his freshman year of high school. Ronnie, a man with a personality much bigger than he is, discovered a kid he didn’t recognize and demanded to know, “And who are you?”</p>\r\n<p>“Without skipping a beat, my brother replied, ‘I’m Michael Alan Sam Jr.!,’” said Ethan Purl, Ronnie’s son. “And after that, he never left.”</p>\r\n<p>“That’s a bunch of shit,” Michael Sr. said. Sure, he said, his son went to the Purls’ on weekends, but “Michael lived at home to the day he graduated.”</p>\r\n<p>“He lived with the rest of us,” agreed Michael Jr.’s sister Michelle.</p>\r\n<p>“The Purls only helped [him] in [his] senior year,” his aunt Geraldine said. “If the Purls were really good people, they’d tell Michael that he was wrong. That he should acknowledge his mother and daddy.”</p>\r\n<p>After a brief phone conversation in which he said he didn’t have time to speak, Ethan Purl did not return repeated phone calls. Ronnie Purl declined a number of interview requests. “Without Michael’s approval I will not be able to speak with you,” he said in an email. “Being in banking, I am very aware of privacy issues.”</p>\r\n<p>Michael Sr. said he met the Purls at least once, when he accompanied Michael Jr. on one of his visits over there.</p>\r\n<p>“I just wanted to see where Michael was going, to make sure where he was going was the right environment,” Michael Sr. said.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, Michael Sr. liked that his youngest son had white friends.

I’m like, <i>What brother knows all of them white songs?</i> That tripped me out.”</p>\r\n<p>On another one of Michael Jr.’s trips home with Vito, Michael Sr. noticed their relationship seemed much closer than a simple friendship. How else to explain Vito coming home for the holidays? Michael Sr. waited until they returned to Missouri to broach his suspicions to his wife. “I told JoAnn, ‘You know, Mike ain’t bring his girlfriend but he brought this dude. That’s kinda funny,’” Michael Sr. said. “But she swore up and down” that he wasn’t gay. “I kept asking Mike was this boy funny? ‘No, Daddy, no. Ain’t nothing wrong with Vito,’ he’d say.”</p>\r\n<p>“He didn’t act gay then either,” Michael Sr. said of Vito.</p>\r\n<p>But during a visit to Missouri for one of Michael Jr.’s games last fall, Michael Sr. became certain about Vito.</p>\r\n<p>“I shook that boy’s hand, and that boy’s hand felt like a woman’s,” Michael Sr. said. “And the boy looked different. I told my brother that that boy right there is gay.”</p>\r\n<p>When they went out for dinner later that night, Michael Jr. showed them a picture of a woman he said he was dating; Michael Jr.’s Instagram account has lots of pictures of him in college posing with young women.</p>\r\n<p>“I still had some suspicions,” Michael Sr. said. But other family members “didn’t wanna believe it. I had intuition about that boy.”</p>\r\n<p>That intuition was finally confirmed this year. On Feb. 4, Michael Sr.’s birthday, he received a text message from his son. “I could tell his PR guy wrote that message because Mike don’t talk like that,” Michael Sr. said. “It was some bullshit. ‘I wanted to inform you that I’m gay.’”</p>\r\n<p>“That’s all you’ve got to say?” Michael Sr. remembered texting Michael Jr. in response. “He texted me back, ‘Happy birthday.’ So I went out and got drunk.”</p>\r\n<p>Five months later, in his room at the nursing home watching the red carpet show before his son would receive the Arthur Ashe Award, Michael Sr. grew wildly upset. He started calling and texting family members and friends.</p>\r\n<p>With Vito at his side, Michael Jr. had been asked what was the most difficult part of coming out. He told the interviewer that it was telling his friends. Michael Sr. was incensed.</p>\r\n<p>“If it was so hard to tell his friends, why didn’t he tell us first?” Michael Sr. said. “It was harder for him to tell us.”</p>\r\n<p>And it probably was. One recent afternoon, Michael Sr.’s brother Charles asked if Michael Jr. might go back to women. Michael Sr. responded, “Women don’t really want to mess with you after doing all that gay shit.”</p>\r\n<p>Michael Sr. is never going to be the spokesman for Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. He’s not thrilled about his son’s sexual orientation. But he also hasn’t disowned his son. He never says his son is going to hell. He doesn’t talk about trying to cure him or make him straight. In his own rough-hewn, coarse way, Michael Sr. has accepted that his son is gay. “I love my son,” he said, “and I don’t care about what he do.”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243564\" rel:buzz_num=\"17\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-12096-1415822894-12.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-12096-1415822894-12.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"436\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 388px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:17\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243564','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-12096-1415822894-12.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Michael Buckner / Getty Images For ESPYS</span></p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The family rift that the ESPY Awards exposed to a national audience had been there, deep and wide, for a while.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243442\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr01/longform-24319-1415822500-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr01/longform-24319-1415822500-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 302px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:16\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243442','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\r\n\t\t\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr01/longform-24319-1415822500-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ›</b></a></p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Will Ebner </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://L.G\">L.G</a>.

Instead of asking his family to attend as guests, he invited the family of Missouri football teammate Will Ebner.</p>\r\n<p>“We found out Will and I were going to be part of his family representing him,” said Elaine Ebner, mother of Will Ebner. “If someone else had come from his family, I would have wanted them to be center stage. I know my place. Mainly, I just wanted to be whatever he wanted me to be.”</p>\r\n<p>Michael Jr.’s aunt Geraldine managed to score tickets from a friend who was a member of the Rotary Club. She also sat in the area designated for family. “When I got there, [Michael Jr.] was glad to see me. It’s always good to have family there,” she said.</p>\r\n<p>Days later, Michael Jr. graduated from the University of Missouri with a degree in parks, recreation, and tourism. Everyone in the family — except Josh and Chris, who were both in jail — made the 600-mile road trip from Texas to celebrate the first of JoAnn’s and Michael Sr.’s children to graduate from college.</p>\r\n<p>To commemorate the occasion, Michael Jr. <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/h6w1JOG8Zk/?modal=true\">posted a picture on Instagram</a> of himself in a cap and gown, a wide smile on his face and an elbow comfortably resting on the mantle of a fireplace. “It’s been a long time coming,” read his caption. He was alone in the photo and made no mention of anyone else being there — in that or any of his other public social media posts from the time.</p>\r\n<p>Later in December, during the week of the Cotton Bowl in Dallas — Michael Jr.’s final college game — Michael Sr. said his son borrowed his car and spent all of his time with Vito and teammates. Michael Sr. also said his son lied to him about the location of the team hotel and then didn’t call him, or return any of his calls, for the rest of the week.</p>\r\n<p>“I had to call him to get him to bring me my car back,” Michael Sr. said. “I kept calling and calling. He didn’t bring the car until the last day, and the game was the next day. He didn’t talk to me or nothing.”</p>\r\n<p>In May, on the weekend of the NFL draft, Michael Jr.’s family was conspicuously absent when TV cameras followed him around at his agent’s home in San Diego. He declined an offer from his father’s family members to attend a draft party they wanted to host in Dallas, his aunt Geraldine and Michael Sr. said. Instead, he spent the weekend in California with Vito, some friends, and his agents.</p>\r\n<p>“If he’s so ashamed of us,” Geraldine remembers one of his sisters telling her, “why doesn’t he just change his name?”</p>\r\n<p>The day the Rams drafted him — when he was so happy that he kissed Vito and smeared his face with celebratory cake — might end up being the pinnacle of Michael Jr.’s NFL career. Now, cut from his second team, he is learning something his father learned long ago: Life can take what you want most.</p>\r\n<p>Since 2000, <i>Outsports</i> noted, every single Defensive Player of the Year from the five major college football conferences made it onto an NFL team — except Michael Sam Jr. And it’s not that he played poorly in preseason. Far from it. He totaled 11 tackles and three sacks, a figure that left him tied for fourth in the league. His bold announcement of his sexuality, which garnered him glamorous accolades, may have also destroyed his football career.</p>\r\n<p>Disappointment and loss are feelings Michael Sr. knows well, of course, so the two Michaels have more in common now than they may have ever had. And yet Michael Jr. doesn’t come to his father — or anyone in his family — for comfort.

  {title: "How American parenting is killing the American marriage", author: "Danielle Teller", pub_date: "2014-09-30", link_identifier: "http://qz.com/273255", main_img_url: "http://img.qz.com/2014/09/rtxwqiy.jpg?w=940, http://img.qz.com/2014/09/rtxwqiy.jpg?w=1880 2x", content: "<div class=\"item-body\" data-article-id=\"273255\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"fb-like-module\"></div>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"4\" data-thread-id=\"111217\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">Sometime between when we were children and when we had children of our own, parenthood became a religion in America. As with many religions, complete unthinking devotion is required from its practitioners. Nothing in life is allowed to be more important than our children, and we must never speak a disloyal word about our relationships with our offspring. Children always come first. We accept this premise so reflexively today that we forget that it was not always so.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"4\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">4</div></div></div></div>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"111218\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">In our recently published book, <em><a href=\"http://diversionbooks.com/ebooks/sacred-cows-truth-about-divorce-and-marriage\" target=\"_blank\">Sacred Cows</a></em>, we took on our society’s nonsensical but deeply ingrained beliefs surrounding marriage and divorce. We often get asked whether we will next address the sacred cows of modern parenting, at which point we ask the speaker to please lower his voice, and we look nervously over our shoulders to make sure that nobody has overheard the question.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"2\" data-thread-id=\"111219\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">To understand the frightening power of the parenthood religion, one need look no further than the 2005 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/fashion/27love.html\" target=\"_blank\">essay in The New York Times </a>by Ayelet Waldman, where the author explained that she loved her husband more than her four children. On “Oprah Where Are They Now,” the author recently reaffirmed the sentiments reflected in her New York Times article, and she added that her outlook has had a positive impact on her children by giving them a sense of security <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/own-where-are-they-now/Does-Ayelet-Waldman-Still-Love-Husband-More-Than-Children-Video\" target=\"_blank\">in their parents’ relationship</a>. Following the publication of her essay, Waldman was not only shouted down by America for being a bad mother; strangers threatened her physically and told her that they would report her to child protective services. This is not how a civil society conducts open-minded discourse. This is how a religion persecutes a heretic.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"2\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">2</div></div></div></div>\r\n<div class=\"inline-ad  ad-visible\" style=\"display: none;\"><iframe id=\"537516121_fx4r\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px;\"></iframe></div>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"3\" data-thread-id=\"111220\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">The origins of the parenthood religion are obscure, but one of its first manifestations may have been the “baby on board” placards that became <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703916004576271282489578512\" target=\"_blank\">popular in the mid-1980s</a>. Nobody would have placed such a sign on a car if it were not already understood by society that the life of a human achieves its peak value at birth and declines thereafter. A toddler is almost as precious as a baby, but a teenager less so, and by the time that baby turns fifty, it seems that nobody cares much anymore if someone crashes into her car. You don’t see a lot of vehicles with placards that read, “Middle-aged accountant on board.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"3\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">3</div></div></div></div>\r\n<h2>Read: <a href=\"http://qz.com/275987/you-probably-dont-know-the-real-story-behind-baby-on-board-signs/\" target=\"_blank\">You probably don’t know the real story behind Baby on Board signs</a>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"2\" data-thread-id=\"111221\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">Another sign of the parenthood religion is that it has become totally unacceptable in our culture to say anything bad about our children, let alone admit that we don’t like them all of the time. We are allowed to say bad things about our spouses, our parents, our aunts and uncles, but try saying, “My kid doesn’t have a lot of friends because she’s not a super likable person,” and see how fast you get dropped from the PTA.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"2\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">2</div></div></div></div>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"1\" data-thread-id=\"111222\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">When people choose to have children, they play a lottery. Children have the same range of positive and negative characteristics as adults, and the personalities of some children are poorly matched with those of their parents. Nature has protected children against such a circumstance by endowing them with irresistible cuteness early on, and by ensuring that parents bond with children sufficiently strongly that our cave-dwelling ancestors didn’t push their offspring out in a snowbank when they misbehaved. Much as parents love their children and have their best interests at heart, however, they don’t always like them. That guy at the office who everyone thinks is a jerk was a kid once upon a time, and there’s a pretty good chance that his parents also noticed that he could be a jerk. They just weren’t allowed to say so.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"1\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">1</div></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"3\" data-thread-id=\"111223\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">Of course, Ayelet Waldman’s blasphemy was not admitting that her kids were less than completely wonderful, only that she loved her husband more than them. This falls into the category of thou-shalt-have-no-other-gods-before-me. As with many religious crimes, judgment is not applied evenly across the sexes. Mothers must devote themselves to their children above anyone or anything else, but many wives would be offended if their husbands said, “You’re pretty great, but my love for you will never hold a candle to the love I have for John Junior.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"3\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">3</div></div></div></div>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"111224\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">Mothers are also holy in a way that fathers are not expected to be. Mothers live in a clean, cheerful world filled with primary colors and children’s songs, and they don’t think about sex. A father could admit to desiring his wife without seeming like a distracted parent, but society is not as willing to cut Ms. Waldman that same slack. It is unseemly for a mother to enjoy pleasures that don’t involve her children.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"2\" data-thread-id=\"111225\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">There are doubtless benefits that come from elevating parenthood to the status of a religion, but there are obvious pitfalls as well. Parents who do not feel free to express their feelings honestly are less likely to resolve problems at home. Children who are raised to believe that they are the center of the universe have a tough time when their special status erodes as they approach adulthood. Most troubling of all, couples who live entirely child-centric lives can lose touch with one another to the point where they have nothing left to say to one another when the kids leave home.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"2\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">2</div></div></div></div>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"4\" data-thread-id=\"111226\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">In the 21st century, most Americans marry for love. We choose partners who we hope will be our soulmates for life. When children come along, we believe that we can press pause on the soulmate narrative, because parenthood has become our new priority and religion. We raise our children as best we can, and we know that we have succeeded if they leave us, going out into the world to find partners and have children of their own. Once our gods have left us, we try to pick up the pieces of our long neglected marriages and find new purpose. Is it surprising that divorce rates are rising fastest for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/fashion/weddings/divorce-after-50-grows-more-common.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">new empty nesters</a>? Perhaps it is time that we gave the parenthood religion a second thought.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"4\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">4</div></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"111227\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\"><em>We welcome your comments at <a href=\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\" target=\"_blank\">ideas@qz.com</a>.

If OPEC managed today to raise oil prices, that would improve the profit picture for US shale, too, and encourage American drillers to send even more supply into the market; before long, OPEC would be back at the same point of having to cut.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"130728\" data-article-id=\"303505\" class=\"annotatable\">As a result, OPEC decided to wait for the market to balance. But this wait could be years—no one knows when, how, and even whether demand will pick up sufficiently to sop up the excess supply; similarly, everyone knows that the US shale boom won’t persist forever, but not when precisely it will tail off.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"130729\" data-article-id=\"303505\" class=\"annotatable\">OPEC hopes—and most analysts presume—that eventually things will revert to “normal,” at least the version of normal that existed the last four decades, in which the cartel became one of the most formidable fixed objects in the global economy.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"130730\" data-article-id=\"303505\" class=\"annotatable\">But that is not guaranteed. One scenario has the shale boom persisting through 2040; by then a big breakthrough could happen in battery technology, making electric cars more competitive, and removing a pillar of future demand growth projections. In that case, OPEC would be permanently neutered. There is simply no telling whether OPEC’s familiar world will return.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<h2>So consult your wish list and act—fast</h2>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"130731\" data-article-id=\"303505\" class=\"annotatable\">Until now, global policymakers have relied on a few presumptions in determining their strategic goals, among them that OPEC and other oil collossals like Russia would remain in commanding positions of leverage, and that scarce resources would lock in one source of friction between China and the West. Because of these fixed realities, Russia and OPEC, when they took an action, could seem to be forbidding forces; they did not seem to need to taper their ambitions in order to get along with the world. In addition, America’s decline seemed steep and inexorable.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"130732\" data-article-id=\"303505\" class=\"annotatable\">But lower oil prices have knocked out the legs underpinning these assumptions. For starters, they mean that many of the countries with the most assertive foreign policies—Russia, Iran and Venezuela among them—are in fiscal trouble. The key fact here is that they could be in this fix for many years to come, and to the degree lower oil prices persist, the less likely they will be able to sustain policies that upset powerful other countries.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"130733\" data-article-id=\"303505\" class=\"annotatable\">For consuming nations, the prudent posture is to view this time of lower prices as a temporary window—a period to last, say, through 2020 or 2022. And, wherever you are sitting, to pose the question—strategically speaking, what do you want?</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"130734\" data-article-id=\"303505\" class=\"annotatable\">If you are the West, would you like Iran to convincingly renounce the development of nuclear weapons? For Russian president Vladimir Putin to temper his adventurism? Then, speak quietly and unprovocatively, and keep pushing—low prices will maintain the pressure and could eventually prove decisive.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"130735\" data-article-id=\"303505\" class=\"annotatable\">If you are an oil-producing state, this is a wake-up call to diversify your economy away from oil.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"130736\" data-article-id=\"303505\" class=\"annotatable\">Much of the change will be chaotic, and the plunge of revenue could create more political instability in the Middle East; it will create some degree of greater oil demand, thus exacerbating climate change.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"130737\" data-article-id=\"303505\" class=\"annotatable\">But most of the changed situation is not yet obvious—this is new terrain and will require policymakers to be alert.

For the past few days my Facebook newsfeed has been full of stories about the incidents unfolding in Ferguson, Missouri.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"9\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">9</div></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"1\" data-thread-id=\"96448\" data-article-id=\"250701\" class=\"annotatable\">But then I realized something.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"1\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">1</div></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"5\" data-thread-id=\"96449\" data-article-id=\"250701\" class=\"annotatable\">For the first couple of days, almost all of the status updates expressing anger and grief about yet another extrajudicial killing of an unarmed black boy, the news articles about the militarized police altercations with community members and the horrifying pictures of his dead body on the city concrete were posted by people of color. Outpourings of rage and demands for justice were voiced by black people, Latinos, Asian Americans, Arab American Muslims. But posts by white people were few at first and those that I saw were posted mostly by my white activist or academic friends who are committed to putting themselves on the frontlines of any conversation about racial or economic injustice in America. And almost nothing, silence practically, by the majority of my nonactivist, nonacademic white friends—those same people who gleefully jumped on the bandwagon to dump buckets of ice over their heads to raise money for ALS and those same people who immediately wrote heartfelt messages about reaching out to loved ones suffering from depression following the suicide of the extraordinary Robin Williams, may he rest in peace. But an unarmed black teenager minding his own business walking down the street in broad daylight gets harassed and murdered by a white police officer and those same people seem to have nothing urgent to say about pervasive, systemic, deadly racism in America?</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"5\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">5</div></div></div></div>\r\n<div class=\"inline-ad\" style=\"display: none;\"></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"96450\" data-article-id=\"250701\" class=\"annotatable\">They have nothing to say?</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"1\" data-thread-id=\"96451\" data-article-id=\"250701\" class=\"annotatable\">Why? The simplest explanation is because Facebook is, well, Facebook. It’s not the New York Times or a town hall meeting or the current events class at your high school. It’s the internet playground for sharing cat videos, cheeky status updates about the joys and tribulations of living with toddlers, and humble bragging about your fabulous European vacation. Some people don’t think Facebook is the forum for serious conversations. Okay, that’s fine if you fall into that category and your wall is nothing but rainbows and happy talk about how much you love your life.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"1\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">1</div></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"3\" data-thread-id=\"96452\" data-article-id=\"250701\" class=\"annotatable\">However, I think the explanation is more complex and mirrors the silence of many people that I witness in real life. A lot of white people aren’t speaking out publicly against the killing of Michael Brown because they don’t see a space for themselves to engage meaningfully in the conversation so that they can move to action against racism. It’s not so much that they have nothing to say but rather they don’t see an opportunity being opened up for them to say something or to do something that matters. Or they might not be sure what to say or how to do it. They might have a hard time seeing a role for themselves in the fight against racism because they aren’t racist, they don’t feel that racism affects them or their loved ones personally, they worry that talking about race and differences between cultures might make things worse, or they think they rarely see overt racism at play in their everyday lives. And, sometimes, they are afraid. There’s a real fear of saying the wrong thing even if the intention is pure, of being alienated socially and economically from other white people for standing in solidarity with black people, or of putting one’s self in harm’s way, whether the harm be physical or psychological. I’m not saying those aren’t valid fears but I am challenging white people to consider carefully whether failing to speak out or act because of those fears is justified when white silence and inaction mean the oppression and death of black people.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"3\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">3</div></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"96453\" data-article-id=\"250701\" class=\"annotatable\">Let’s talk about an active role for white people in the fight against racism because racism burdens all of us and is destroying our communities. And, quite frankly, because white people have a role in undoing racism because white people created and, for the most part, currently maintain (whether they want to or not) the racist system that benefits white people to the detriment of people of color. My white friends who’ve spoken out harshly against the murder of Michael Brown end with a similar refrain: What can I do that will matter in the fight against racism?</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"96454\" data-article-id=\"250701\" class=\"annotatable\">White people who are sick and tired of racism should work hard to become white allies.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"1\" data-thread-id=\"96455\" data-article-id=\"250701\" class=\"annotatable featured-annotation-paragraph\" data-featured=\"true\">In the aftermath of the murder of Michael Brown, may he rest in power, here are some ways for white people to become white allies who are engaged thoughtfully and critically in examining the situation in Ferguson and standing on the side of justice and equity.

If you start calling out all the racism you witness (and it will be a lot once you know what you’re looking at) some people might not want to hang out with you as much. That’s a risk you’ll need to accept. But think about it like this: staying silent when you witness oppression is the same as supporting oppression. So you can be the popular person who stands with the oppressor or you can be the (maybe) unpopular person who stands for equality and dignity for all people. Which person would you prefer to be? And honestly, if some people don’t want to hang out with you anymore once you show yourself as a white ally then why would you even want to be friends with them anyway?

The epic, Mahabharata, for example, refers to a time when there was no concept of marriage. Men and women were free to go to anyone, until it became important to establish fatherhood (‘this son is mine’), for which ownership and fidelity of women became critical (‘she is the field for my seed’).</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"130761\" data-article-id=\"300432\" class=\"annotatable\">Fatherhood became important because property became important (‘this is mine’) and with it the idea of inheritance (‘what is mine shall go to my sons’).

There are stories of men who become women, and women who become men, of men who create children without women, and women who create children without men, and of creatures who are neither this, nor that, but a little bit of both, like the makara (a combination of fish and elephant) or the yali (a combination of lion and elephant). There are also many words in Sanskrit, Prakrit and Tamil such as kliba, napumsaka, mukhabhaga, sanda, panda, pandaka, pedi that suggest a long familiarity with queer thought and behaviour.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"130767\" data-article-id=\"300432\" class=\"annotatable\">It is common to either deny the existence of such fluidity in our stories, or simply locate them in the realm of the supernatural or point to law books that, besides endorsing patriarchy and casteism, also frown upon queer behaviour.

I explain about air-chilled, and free-range, and grain-fed, and hormone-free. I realize that I don’t actually understand “air-chilled.” I send her clear across the store to go find peanut oil.

An explosion of some kind. And her older brother started panicking, telling her it was gunshots, telling her to close the blinds and hide on the floor. And how she became terrified and FaceTimed Mommy from her iPad. And Mommy tried to calm her down, but eventually came right home, leaving a cart filled with groceries in the aisle.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"130674\" data-article-id=\"303521\" class=\"annotatable\">Helicopters are already circling downtown.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"130675\" data-article-id=\"303521\" class=\"annotatable\">She tells me that she now knows that they were overreacting.

Rare is the day that one has school and the other doesn’t. They are so used to being together in the same cars, on the same schedule, even at different schools, that when they see each other, there is awkwardness. They want to check in. If they were adults, they might say “how was your day?” and “I missed you!” But they are not adults. So they argue about who is the worst teacher at the elementary school, and then reminisce about funny episodes of sitcoms that they’ve watched. She quizzes him on his menu, keen to make sure that he didn’t get an ice cream or a cookie on his day off. She’s always keeping track of things like this.

  {title: "What riding my bike has taught me about white privilege", author: "Jeremy Dowsett", pub_date: "2014-08-29", link_identifier: "http://qz.com/257474", main_img_url: "http://img.qz.com/2014/08/ap526270506110.jpg?w=940, http://img.qz.com/2014/08/ap526270506110.jpg?w=1880 2x", content: "<div class=\"item-body\" data-article-id=\"257474\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"fb-like-module\"></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100883\" data-article-id=\"257474\">The phrase “white privilege” is one that rubs a lot of white people the wrong way. It can trigger something in them that shuts down conversation or at least makes them very defensive. (Especially those who grew up relatively less privileged than other folks around them). And I’ve seen more than once where this happens and the next move in the conversation is for the person who brought up white privilege to say, “The reason you’re getting defensive is because you’re feeling the discomfort of having your privilege exposed.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100884\" data-article-id=\"257474\"><span class=\"s1\">I’m sure that’s true sometimes. And I’m sure there are a lot of people, white and otherwise, who can attest to a kind of a-ha moment or paradigm shift where they “got” what privilege means and they did realize they had been getting defensive because they were uncomfortable at having their privilege exposed. But I would guess that more often than not, the frustration and the shutting down is about something else. It comes from the fact that nobody wants to be a racist. And the move “you only think that because you’re looking at this from the perspective of privilege” or the more terse and confrontational “check your privilege!” kind of sound like an accusation that someone is a racist (if they don’t already understand privilege). And the phrase “white privilege” kind of sounds like, “You are a racist and there’s nothing you can do about it because you were born that way.”</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100885\" data-article-id=\"257474\"><span class=\"s1\">And if this were what “white privilege” meant—which it does not—defensiveness and frustration would be the appropriate response. But privilege talk is not intended to make a moral assessment or a moral claim about the privileged at all. It is about systemic imbalance. It is about injustices that have arisen because of the history of racism that birthed the way things are now. It’s not saying, “You’re a bad person because you’re white.” It’s saying, “The system is skewed in ways that you maybe haven’t realized or had to think about precisely because it’s skewed in <em>your</em> favor.”</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100886\" data-article-id=\"257474\"><span class=\"s1\">I am white. So I have not experienced racial privilege from the “under” side firsthand. But my children (and a lot of other people I love) are not white. And so I care about privilege and what it means for racial justice in our country. And one experience I have had firsthand, which has helped me to understand privilege and listen to privilege talk without feeling defensive, is riding my bike.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<figure id=\"image-257475\" class=\"inline-image  alignright zoomable size-small\"><div class=\"inline-image-tools\">\r\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"share-button\" data-image-id=\"257475\">Share</a><div class=\"share-icons desaturated\">\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F257474%2Fwhat-riding-my-bike-has-taught-me-about-white-privilege%2Fi%2F257475%2F&amp;text=What+riding+my+bike+has+taught+me+about+white+privilege&amp;via=qz\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"icon-twitter\"></a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F257474%2Fwhat-riding-my-bike-has-taught-me-about-white-privilege%2Fi%2F257475%2F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"icon-facebook\"></a>\r\n</div>\r\n<span class=\"help-text\"><i class=\"icon-zoom\"></i>Tap image to zoom</span>\r\n</div>\r\n<img src=\"http://img.qz.com/2014/08/image3.jpg?w=474\" data-retina=\"http://img.qz.com/2014/08/image3.jpg?w=474\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></figure><p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100887\" data-article-id=\"257474\" class=\"annotatable\">Now, I know, it sounds a little goofy at first. But stick with me. Because I think that this can be an analogy that might help some white people understand privilege talk without feeling like they’re having their character attacked.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100888\" data-article-id=\"257474\" class=\"annotatable\">About five years ago I decide to start riding my bike as my primary mode of transportation. As in, on the street, in traffic. Which is enjoyable for a number of reasons (exercise, wind in yer face, the cool feeling of going fast, etc.) But thing is, I don’t live in Portland or Minneapolis. I live in the capital city of the epicenter of the auto industry: Lansing, Michigan. This is not, by any stretch, a bike-friendly town. And often, it is down-right dangerous to be a bike commuter here.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100889\" data-article-id=\"257474\" class=\"annotatable\">Now sometimes its dangerous for me because people in cars are just blatantly a**holes to me. If I am in the road—where I legally belong—people will yell at me to get on the sidewalk. If I am on the sidewalk—which is sometimes the safest place to be—people will yell at me to get on the road. People in cars think its funny to roll down their window and yell something right when they get beside me. Or to splash me on purpose. People I have never met are angry at me for just being on a bike or for being in “their” road and they let me know with colorful language and other acts of aggression.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100890\" data-article-id=\"257474\" class=\"annotatable\">I can imagine that for people of color life in a white-majority context feels a bit like being on a bicycle in midst of traffic. They have the right to be on the road, and laws on the books to make it equitable, but that doesn’t change the fact that they are on a bike in a world made for cars. Remembering this when I’m on my bike in traffic has helped me to understand what privilege talk is really about.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100891\" data-article-id=\"257474\" class=\"annotatable\">Now most people in cars are not intentionally aggressive toward me. But even if all the jerks had their licenses revoked tomorrow, the road would still be a dangerous place for me. Because the whole transportation infrastructure privileges the automobile. It is born out of a history rooted in the auto industry that took for granted that everyone should use a car as their mode of transportation. It’s not built to be convenient or economical or safe for me.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100892\" data-article-id=\"257474\" class=\"annotatable\">And so people in cars—nice, non-aggressive people—put me in danger all the time because they see the road from the privileged perspective of a car. E.g., I ride on the right side of the right lane. Very few people change lanes to pass me (as they would for another car) or even give me a wide berth. Some people fly by just inches from me not realizing how scary and dangerous that is for me (like if I were to swerve to miss some roadkill just as they pass). These non-aggressive close-passers don’t realize that a pothole or a build up of gravel or a broken bottle, which they haven’t given me enough room to avoid and which they don’t even have to be aware of, could send me flying from my bike or cost me a bent rim or a flat tire.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100893\" data-article-id=\"257474\" class=\"annotatable\">So the semi driver who rushes past throwing gravel in my face in his hot wake isn’t necessarily a bad guy. He could be sitting in his cab listening to Christian radio and thinking about nice things he can do for his wife. But the fact that “the system” allows him to do those things instead of being mindful of me is a privilege he has that I don’t. (I have to be hyper-aware of him).</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100894\" data-article-id=\"257474\" class=\"annotatable\">This is what privilege is about. Like drivers, nice, non-aggressive white people can move in the world without thinking about the “potholes” or the “gravel” that people of color have to navigate, or how things that they do—not intending to hurt or endanger anyone—might actually be making life more difficult or more dangerous for a person of color.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100895\" data-article-id=\"257474\" class=\"annotatable\">Nice, non-aggressive drivers that don’t do anything at all to endanger me are still privileged to pull out of their driveway each morning and know that there are roads that go all the way to their destination. They don’t have to wonder if there are bike lanes and what route they will take to stay safe. In the winter, they can be certain that the snow will be plowed out of their lane into my lane and not the other way around.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100896\" data-article-id=\"257474\"><span class=\"s1\">And it’s not just the fact that the whole transportation infrastructure is built around the car. It’s the law, which is poorly enforced when cyclists are hit by cars, the fact that gas is subsidized by the government and bike tires aren’t, and just the general mindset of a culture that is in love with cars after a hundred years of propaganda and still thinks that bikes are toys for kids and triathletes.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100897\" data-article-id=\"257474\">So when I say the semi driver is privileged, it isn’t a way of calling him a bad person or a man-slaughterer or saying he didn’t really earn his truck, but just way of acknowledging all that–infrastructure, laws, government, culture–and the fact that if he and I get in a collision, I will probably die and he will just have to clean the blood off of his bumper. In the same way, talking about <i>racial</i> privilege isn’t a way of telling white people they are bad people or racists or that they didn’t really earn what they have.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100898\" data-article-id=\"257474\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s a way of trying to make visible the fact that system is not neutral, it is not a level-playing field, it’s not the same experience for everyone. There are biases and imbalances and injustices built into the warp and woof of our culture. (The <a href=\"http://alittlemoresauce.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/the-death-of-mike-brown-and-the-death-of-the-church/\">recent events in Ferguson</a>, Missouri, <a href=\"http://alittlemoresauce.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/the-death-of-mike-brown-and-the-death-of-the-church/\">should be evidence enough of this</a>). Not because you personally are a racist, but because the system has a history and was built around this category “race” and that’s not going to go away over night (or even in 100 years). To go back to my analogy: Bike lanes are relatively new, and still just kind of an appendage on a system that is inherentyly car-centric.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100899\" data-article-id=\"257474\">So–white readers–the next time someone drops the p-word, try to remember they aren’t calling you a racist or saying you didn’t really earn your college degree, they just want you to try empathize with how scary it is to be on a bike sometimes (metaphorically speaking).</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100900\" data-article-id=\"257474\">One last thing: Now, I know what it is like to be a white person engaged in racial reconciliation or justice work and to feel like privilege language is being used to silence you or to feel frustrated that you are genuinely trying to be a part of the solution not the problem but every time you open your mouth someone says, “Check you privilege.” (I.e., even though privilege language doesn’t mean “You are one of the bad guys,” some people do use it that way). So if you’ll permit me to get a few more miles out of this bike analogy (ya see what I did there?), I think it can help encourage white folks  who have felt that frustration to stay engaged and stay humble.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100901\" data-article-id=\"257474\">I have a lot of “conversations” with drivers. Now, rationally, I know that most drivers are not jerks. But I have a long and consistent history of bad experiences with drivers and so, when I’ve already been honked at or yelled at that day, or when I’ve read a blog post about a fellow cyclist who’s been mowed down by a careless driver, it’s hard for me to stay civil.</p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"1\" data-thread-id=\"100902\" data-article-id=\"257474\"><span class=\"s1\">But when I’m not so civil with “privileged” drivers, it’s not because I hate them, or think they are evil. It’s because it’s the third time that day I got some gravel in the face. So try to remember that even if you don’t feel like a “semi driver,” a person of color might be experiencing you the way a person on a bike experiences being passed by a semi. Even if you’re listening to Christian radio.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"1\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">1</div></div></div></div>\r\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"100903\" data-article-id=\"257474\"><em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"http://alittlemoresauce.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/what-my-bike-has-taught-me-about-white-privilege/\">A Little More Sauce</a>. We welcome your comments at <a href=\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\" target=\"_blank\">ideas@qz.com</a>.</em></p>\r\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"item-share-tools article-footer\">\r\n<div class=\"short-url\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"shortURL\" value=\"http://qz.com/257474\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"share-buttons colored\"><ul data-author=\"Jeremy Dowsett\" data-title=\"What riding my bike has taught me about white privilege\" data-on=\"none\">\r\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a title=\"Tweet\" class=\"share-action icon-twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=What%20riding%20my%20bike%20has%20taught%20me%20about%20white%20privilege&amp;url=http://qz.com/257474&amp;via=qz\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a title=\"Share on Facebook\" class=\"share-action icon-facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://qz.com/257474\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"linkedin\"><a title=\"Share on LinkedIn\" class=\"share-action icon-linkedin\" href=\"http://linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=http://qz.com/257474&amp;title=What%20riding%20my%20bike%20has%20taught%20me%20about%20white%20privilege&amp;summary=The%20phrase%20%E2%80%9Cwhite%20privilege%E2%80%9D%20is%20one%20that%20rubs%20a%20lot%20of%20white%20people%20the%20wrong%20way.%20It%20can%20trigger%20something%20in%20them%20that%20shuts%20down%20conversation%20or%20at%20least%20makes%20them%20very%20defensive.%20(Especially%20those%20who%20grew%20up%20relatively%20less%20privileged%20than%20other%20folks%20around%20them).%20And%20I%E2%80%99ve%20seen%20more%20than%20once%20where%20this%20happens%20%5B%E2%80%A6%5D\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"email\"><a title=\"Email\" class=\"share-action icon-email\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Quartz:%20What%20riding%20my%20bike%20has%20taught%20me%20about%20white%20privilege&amp;body=http://qz.com/257474%0A%0AThe%20phrase%20%E2%80%9Cwhite%20privilege%E2%80%9D%20is%20one%20that%20rubs%20a%20lot%20of%20white%20people%20the%20wrong%20way.%20It%20can%20trigger%20something%20in%20them%20that%20shuts%20down%20conversation%20or%20at%20least%20makes%20them%20very%20defensive.%20(Especially%20those%20who%20grew%20up%20relatively%20less%20privileged%20than%20other%20folks%20around%20them).%20And%20I%E2%80%99ve%20seen%20more%20than%20once%20where%20this%20happens%20%5B%E2%80%A6%5D%0A%0A\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\r\n<li class=\"whatsapp\"><a title=\"Share on WhatsApp\" class=\"share-action icon-whats-app\" href=\"whatsapp://send?text=What%20riding%20my%20bike%20has%20taught%20me%20about%20white%20privilege:%20http://qz.com/257474\"></a></li>\r\n</ul></div>\r\n<div id=\"related-headlines-257474\" class=\"empty\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>"}
